A chemical or biological species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as &#x27;nitrogen&#x27; or a phrase such as &#x27;nox_expressed_as_nitrogen&#x27;.The phrase &#x27;expressed_as&#x27; is used in the construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A. Diatoms are single-celled phytoplankton with an external skeleton made of silica.Phytoplankton are autotrophic prokaryotic or eukaryotic algae that live near the water surface where there is sufficient light to support photosynthesis.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>mole_concentration_of_diatoms_expressed_as_carbon_in_sea_water</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>3ba74e62-8ca2-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>physical_parameters:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="f86eb6af-8ca1-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654.html">phycdiat (Mole Concentration of Diatoms Expressed as Carbon in Sea Water)</a></li><li><a href="5880ab9386066d5d620774a46840cc25.html">phydiat (Mole Concentration of Diatoms Expressed as Carbon in Sea Water)</a></li><li><a href="c96ce1ee-c5f0-11e6-ac20-5404a60d96b5.html">phydiatos (Surface Mole Concentration of Diatoms Expressed as Carbon in Sea Water)</a></li></ul></details><br><br><p><a href='../cf_standard_names.html'>Back to cf_standard_names</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
