Deposition variables are useful for ecosystems, agriculture, and water resources analyses. CHELSA uses mechanistical statistical downscaling of global circulation model output to provide such high-resolution climatologies that serve a broad array of impact sectors, for example within ISIMIP.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Use 1000 to mean &quot;as many as possible&quot;.'><strong>desirable_ensemble_size</strong></td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Explain why this combination of data and experiments is important. How will it contribute to CMIP objectives?'><strong>expected_impacts</strong></td><td>Facilitating the production of bias-adjusted and higher-resolution climate data will allow driving input data for many fine-scale impact models. ISIMIP’s bias-adjustment approach provides inputs to a prominent community of modelers producing high-profile impact sector projections that are widely cited in publications and assessments such as the IPCC. ISIMIP organization helps consolidate outputs that are of use for multiple impacts and adaptation applications, and their bias-adjusted and spatially disaggregated outputs are of wide use even beyond their formal simulation phases. Requested variable sets also allow for the production of CHELSA high-resolution climatologies, which are of wide use within ISIMIP and beyond.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Explain how the data products requested map onto the expected outcomes. Include reference to the level of resources that will be needed to support this request and why they are proportionate to the expected impact.'><strong>justification_of_resources</strong></td><td>Outputs enable a vital pipeline for sectoral applications by allowing bias-adjustment and drivers for a large number of impacts sector models (agriculture, water resources, ecosystems, fisheries, health, energy). So far, they disaggregate daily data on their own which is a major source of bias in the respective impact simulations. The data would enable consistency between impact simulations at sub-daily (so far mostly regional) and daily scales. ISIMIP has an established community of modelers and coordinates simulations across multiple sectors so that results may be coherently connected for cross-sectoral implications.  High resolution bias-adjustment is of particular use for ecosystem impacts in complex terrain such as mountains coastlines.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Lead theme will coordinate communication and actions for the Opportunity'><strong>lead_theme</strong></td><td><span><a href="527f5c8f-8c97-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654.html">Impacts &amp; Adaptation</a></span></td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Default ensemble size, excluding multiple start times.
