A chemical or biological species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as &quot;nitrogen&quot; or a phrase such as &quot;nox_expressed_as_nitrogen&quot;. The phrase &quot;expressed_as&quot; is used in the construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A. The chemical formula of the carbonate anion is CO3 with an electrical charge of minus two. Aragonite is a mineral that is a polymorph of calcium carbonate. The chemical formula of aragonite is CaCO3. At a given salinity, the thermodynamic equilibrium is that between dissolved carbonate ion and solid aragonite. Standard names also exist for calcite, another polymorph of calcium carbonate.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>mole_concentration_of_carbonate_expressed_as_carbon_at_equilibrium_with_pure_aragonite_in_sea_water</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>3ba74e52-8ca2-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>physical_parameters:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="065edaa295c376f0e9bc1985bc3f491c.html">co3satarag (Mole Concentration of Carbonate Ion in Equilibrium with Pure Aragonite in Sea Water)</a></li><li><a href="c96f0758-c5f0-11e6-ac20-5404a60d96b5.html">co3sataragos (Surface Mole Concentration of Carbonate Ion in Equilibrium with Pure Aragonite in Sea Water)</a></li></ul></details><br><p><a href='../cf_standard_names.html'>Back to cf_standard_names</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
