It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A. In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, &quot;flux&quot; implies per unit area, called &quot;flux density&quot; in physics. &#x27;Sinking&#x27; is the gravitational settling of particulate matter suspended in a liquid. A sinking flux is positive downwards and is calculated relative to the movement of the surrounding fluid. &quot;Particulate organic nitrogen&quot; means the sum of all organic nitrogen compounds, which are solid or which are bound to solid particles. &quot;Organic nitrogen&quot;, when measured, always refers to all nitrogen incorporated in carbon compounds in the sample. Models may use the term to refer to nitrogen contained in specific groups of organic compounds in which case the data variable should be accompanied by a complete description of the species represented, for example, by using a comment attribute.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>sinking_mole_flux_at_sea_floor_of_particulate_organic_nitrogen_in_sea_water</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>80ac321a-a698-11ef-914a-613c0433d878</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>physical_parameters:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="f86eb697-8ca1-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654.html">expnob (Sinking Flux of Particulate Organic Nitrogen Reaching the Ocean Bottom)</a></li></ul></details><br><p><a href='../cf_standard_names.html'>Back to cf_standard_names</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
