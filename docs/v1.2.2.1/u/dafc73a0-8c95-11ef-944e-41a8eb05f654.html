Climate services and climate impact modelling are a vital step in the value chain for understanding and managing the risks of a changing climate.  The communities that undertake these activities depend on CMIP data outputs as inputs to onward &quot;impact&quot; models (e.g., for energy, water, agriculture, financial services, health).  These impact models can be highly complex with non-linear dependences on meteorological properties.  Many of these impact models themselves use only a handful of common surface/near-surface variables but require fine-resolution data in both time and space.  Hitherto, the availability of such input data from CMIP has been - at best - patchy.  This has inhibited impact modelling by requiring compromises on impact model resolution (e.g., use of daily or monthly rather than sub-daily ) and inter-model comparison (e.g., only a few CMIP models providing relevant output), or prevented the application of CMIP simulations in high-quality impact models completely.

The proposal is therefore for CMIP models running &#x27;real world&#x27; simulations to output a small set of surface/near-surface climate variables at sub-daily (preferably hourly) grid-point resolution to support the provision of climate impact modelling, climate services and climate adaptation across a wide range of topics, including but not limited to infrastructure, energy, finance, health, agriculture &amp; water.  It is therefore tressed that while this request is substantial, it is intended to support a wide range of activities and &quot;downstream&quot; impact communities.

This opportunity requests data throughout the entire simulation period. However, if high temporal resolution data is difficult to provide for the entire period, this opportunity can be supported with data from the following time subsets:
hist72 and histext + whole timeseries (2021-2100): first preference,
hist43 and histext + whole timeseries (2021-2100): second preference,
hist43 and histext + scenario30mid + scenario20: third preference,
hist43 and histext + scenario20mid + scenario20: fourth preference,
hist20 and histext + scenario20mid + scenario20: fifth preference.
histext is included because the I&amp;A community would like historical data that are as close to the present as possible.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Use 1000 to mean &quot;as many as possible&quot;.'><strong>desirable_ensemble_size</strong></td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Explain why this combination of data and experiments is important. How will it contribute to CMIP objectives?'><strong>expected_impacts</strong></td><td>Use cases in climate services and impact modelling are many and varied.  High frequency data in this requests underpins many different areas of activity (though in some applicaitons additional data may also be required).  Examples include:

**Power system planning **(design and operation of high-renewables electricity systems for decarbonisation) - uses detailed optimisation models to represent complex internal dynamics.  Require minimum hourly resolution.
**Sub-daily Extreme Analysis (CORDEX, Climate Services).**
**SurgeMIP (storm surge community) **- storm surge**.**
**Building energy use modelling.**</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Explain how the data products requested map onto the expected outcomes.

This is to underpin a very wide range of climate service activities in support of climate impact assessment and climate adaptation.  The onward modelling often requires higher frequency data than has previously been provided by CMIP creating a substantial barrier to climate service provision.  This proposal hopes to overcome this barrier.  See, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joule.2022.05.010" target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joule.2022.05.010</a> for a detailed discussion in the energy sector, but please note that the Impacts and Adaptation group emerged many demands for hourly data needs across multiple sectors.  We feel this request brings together the needs of this disparate community in an efficient and feasible way for the future.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Lead theme will coordinate communication and actions for the Opportunity'><strong>lead_theme</strong></td><td><span><a href="527f5c8f-8c97-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654.html">Impacts &amp; Adaptation</a></span></td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Default ensemble size, excluding multiple start times.
