The quantity with standard name covariance_over_longitude_of_northward_wind_and_air_temperature is the covariance of the deviations of meridional air velocity and air temperature about their respective zonal mean values. The data variable must be accompanied by a vertical coordinate variable or scalar coordinate variable and is calculated on an isosurface of that vertical coordinate. "Northward" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed northward (negative southward). Wind is defined as a two-dimensional (horizontal) air velocity vector, with no vertical component. (Vertical motion in the atmosphere has the standard name "upward_air_velocity"). Air temperature is the bulk temperature of the air, not the surface (skin) temperature. It is strongly recommended that a variable with this standard name should have the attribute units_metadata="temperature: difference", meaning that it refers to temperature differences and implying that the origin of the temperature scale is irrelevant, because it is essential to know whether a temperature is on-scale or a difference in order to convert the units correctly (cf. <a href="https://cfconventions.org/cf-conventions/cf-conventions.html#temperature-units" target="_blank">https://cfconventions.org/cf-conventions/cf-conventions.html#temperature-units</a>).</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>covariance_over_longitude_of_northward_wind_and_air_temperature</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>3ba66677-8ca2-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>physical_parameters:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="76248ae1d72c976495be67161d5a8d7d.html">vt100 (Northward Eddy Temperature Flux)</a></li></ul></details><br><p><a href='../cf_standard_names.html'>Back to cf_standard_names</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
