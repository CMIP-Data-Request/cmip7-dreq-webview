In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, &quot;flux&quot; implies per unit area, called &quot;flux density&quot; in physics. The phrase &quot;expressed_as&quot; is used in the construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A. The chemical formula for nitrous oxide is N2O. &quot;Vegetation&quot; means any living plants e.g. trees, shrubs, grass. The term &quot;plants&quot; refers to the kingdom of plants in the modern classification which excludes fungi. Plants are autotrophs i.e. &quot;producers&quot; of biomass using carbon obtained from carbon dioxide. &quot;Litter&quot; is dead plant material in or above the soil. It is distinct from coarse wood debris. The precise distinction between &quot;fine&quot; and &quot;coarse&quot; is model dependent.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>surface_upward_mass_flux_of_nitrous_oxide_expressed_as_nitrogen_out_of_vegetation_and_litter_and_soil</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>3ba8dd0a-8ca2-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>physical_parameters:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="5912cf78-9e49-11e5-803c-0d0b866b59f3.html">fN2O (Total Land N2O Flux)</a></li></ul></details><br><p><a href='../cf_standard_names.html'>Back to cf_standard_names</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
