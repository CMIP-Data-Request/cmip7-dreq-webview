The specification of a physical process by the phrase due_to_process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. &quot;Frazil&quot; consists of needle like crystals of ice, typically between three and four millimeters in diameter, which form as sea water begins to freeze. Salt is expelled during the freezing process and frazil ice consists of nearly pure fresh water. Leads are stretches of open water within wider areas of sea ice.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>tendency_of_sea_ice_amount_due_to_frazil_ice_accumulation_in_leads</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>3ba9a845-8ca2-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>physical_parameters:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="59149c7c-9e49-11e5-803c-0d0b866b59f3.html">sidmassgrowthwat (Sea-Ice Mass Change Through Growth in Supercooled Open Water (Frazil))</a></li></ul></details><br><br><p><a href='../cf_standard_names.html'>Back to cf_standard_names</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
