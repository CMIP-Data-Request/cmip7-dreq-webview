Gross primary production is the rate of synthesis of biomass from inorganic precursors by autotrophs (&quot;producers&quot;), for example, photosynthesis in plants or phytoplankton. The producers also respire some of this biomass and the difference is &quot;net_primary_production&quot;. &quot;Productivity&quot; means production per unit area. The phrase &quot;expressed_as&quot; is used in the construction &quot;A_expressed_as_B&quot;, where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A. The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. &quot;Sea ice&quot; means all ice floating in the sea which has formed from freezing sea water, rather than by other processes such as calving of land ice to form icebergs. Sea-ice algae (or simply &#x27;ice algae&#x27; when the context of sea ice is clear) refer to algae uniquely able to thrive within the sea-ice environment. This distinction from phytoplankton is essential, as several phytoplankton species that become trapped in sea ice eventually perish due to a lack of genetic adaptation or acclimation strategies to survive such conditions. By referring to &#x27;sea-ice algae, &#x27; we highlight these algae&#x27;s specific features and ecological significance within the sea-ice habitat.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>gross_primary_productivity_of_biomass_expressed_as_carbon_due_to_ice_algae_in_sea_ice</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>74294479-a5f0-11ef-a35c-1bba421d86ca</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>physical_parameters:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="f86eb6ce-8ca1-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654.html">sigpp (Gross Primary Productivity in Sea Ice as Carbon Amount Flux)</a></li></ul></details><br><br><p><a href='../cf_standard_names.html'>Back to cf_standard_names</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
