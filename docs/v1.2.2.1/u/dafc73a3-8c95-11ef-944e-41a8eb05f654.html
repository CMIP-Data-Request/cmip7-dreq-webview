The high priority list of variables contains those that are necessary for basic storm tracking algorithms or methods used to identify blocking, MJO, etc, as well as variables used for Eulerian storm track metrics and for quantifying the cloud radiative effects of storms.  This high priority list also contains vertically integrated water vapor transports for tracking atmospheric rivers, as well as variables such as high frequency precipitation and temperature to examine the impacts of storms.  The medium priority list of variables consist of other high frequency variables on different pressure levels that can be useful for classifying different synoptic systems e.g., identifying monsoon low pressure systems, distinguishing tropical from extra-tropical cyclones, and computing upper level shear.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Explain why this combination of data and experiments is important.

(1) Assessing whether models can reproduce historical storm track trends (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-024-00640-2" target="_blank">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-024-00640-2</a>)
