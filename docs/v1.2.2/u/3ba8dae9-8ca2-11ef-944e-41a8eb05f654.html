The term &quot;shortwave&quot; means shortwave radiation. Downwelling radiation is radiation from above. It does not mean &quot;net downward&quot;. The sign convention is that &quot;upwelling&quot; is positive upwards and &quot;downwelling&quot; is positive downwards. When thought of as being incident on a surface, a radiative flux is sometimes called &quot;irradiance&quot;. In addition, it is identical with the quantity measured by a cosine-collector light-meter and sometimes called &quot;vector irradiance&quot;. In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, &quot;flux&quot; implies per unit area, called &quot;flux density&quot; in physics. A phrase &quot;assuming_condition&quot; indicates that the named quantity is the value which would obtain if all aspects of the system were unaltered except for the assumption of the circumstances specified by the condition. &quot;Clear sky&quot; means in the absence of clouds.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>surface_diffuse_downwelling_shortwave_flux_in_air_assuming_clear_sky</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>3ba8dae9-8ca2-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>physical_parameters:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="6ca9dd8a089b15fb96841e9fe56411cf.html">rsdscsdiff (Surface Diffuse Downwelling Clear Sky Shortwave Radiation)</a></li></ul></details><br><p><a href='../cf_standard_names.html'>Back to cf_standard_names</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
