How will it contribute to CMIP objectives?'><strong>expected_impacts</strong></td><td>This opportunity allows investigations of acute health risks related to heat and cold stress, including heat stroke and heat exhaustion. The core heat-health variable group allows for investigation of a number of heat-humidity analyses that reflects how the human body&#x27;s ability to regulate its temperature depends on both temperature and the ability of perspiration to evaporate. Additional variables allow for more complex indices and biophysical energy balances including radiation and wind speed. Heat-health impacts are particularly important for young and old populations, outdoor construction and agricultural workers, tourism, and disaster preparation associated with heatwaves. 
Direct analysis and connections to hydrologic models for projecting changes in extreme flood conditions, which may require variables indicating large-scale conditions that may be conducive to flood conditions including snow pack, near-saturated soils, and heavy rainfall events. These variables are requested by health experts to understand future threats to settlements and populations at risk of floods, which also has implications for settlements, disaster reduction, socioeconomic development priorities, migration, and adaptation actions.
Outputs will be used to investigate changing mixing ratios of particulate matter, NO2, and O3 may affect human health. In order to anticipate future health crises, experts have interest in the regional patterns and time evolution of dangerous air pollution conditions as well as interactions between the climate system and air pollution (e.g., temperature and humidity conditions that may be conducive to chemical reactions, circulation patterns, and acute extremes). This information cannot be determined only from emissions data and projections. Daily outputs are of highest priority, with hourly outputs also allowing for further resolution of acute air pollution conditions.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Explain how the data products requested map onto the expected outcomes. Include reference to the level of resources that will be needed to support this request and why they are proportionate to the expected impact.'><strong>justification_of_resources</strong></td><td>Heat impacts are of high interest to the general population and a large number of public, private, civil society, and non-governmental organizations. Climate adaptation planning benefits from forewarning of the shifting distribution of heat waves and their distinctive characteristics (including interaction with humidity). Health impacts experts are creating more accurate and more representative (but sometimes more complex) health indices, and providing these variables will allow for prominent climate risk and proactive planning work, either with direct CMIP7 outputs or through further bias-adjusted information.

Air pollution outputs are important demonstrations of ESMs&#x27; atmospheric chemistry modules, with projections allowing a large number of human health air pollution impact evaluations. Including variables beyond the particulate matter physical parameters helps to track air pollution conditions that may be more confidently represented in ESMs. Daily outputs are of highest priority, with sub-daily outputs allowing for more complex and detailed analyses.

Flooding outputs allow for more detailed hydrologic modeling and analysis of the changing intensity, frequency, and duration of high water events that can be used for engineering and disaster reduction planning.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Lead theme will coordinate communication and actions for the Opportunity'><strong>lead_theme</strong></td><td><span><a href="527f5c8f-8c97-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654.html">Impacts &amp; Adaptation</a></span></td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Default ensemble size, excluding multiple start times.
