Surface ocean waves has a huge impact in our modern society, from ship routes (Nielsen &amp; Iknomakis, 2021), ports and harbors operations and safety (Nikolaos et. al. 2021), coastal erosion  (Pang et al. 2020), and many others. Also wind driven surface gravity waves affects several marine and atmosphere processes like: marine aerosols formations ( Dziembor, 2018), modulation of the air-sea fluxes (Qi et al. , 2024; Wu et al. 2022),  tropical cyclones maintenance and decay ( Zhang, et al. 2023), ocean mixing layer depths (Kantha &amp; Clayson, 2004), planetary boundary layer profile and stability (Wu,  2022), among others processes. 
Estimating the role of the ocean&#x27;s surface waves in the sea-level rise is under discussion ( Aucan et al., 2019) .
Sea-ice also might be affected by ocean waves as well (Alberello et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2024), due to ice and waves interactions, such as wave induced fracturing, lateral and bottom melting (Yang et al., 2024), air-sea-ocean fluxes exchange. 

General wave parameters (i.e. Significant Wave Height (SWH), Mean Period (MP), Peak Period (PP), mean direction (MD), peak direction (PD)) among partitioned parameters (same but for windsea and swells) are important to better represent all processes listed above. 
It is nice to mention that the ocean surface wave community has joint efforts to create the COWCLIP (Coordinated Ocean Wave Climate Project). This project aims to raise the profile of wind-waves as a variable in the global climate system to both foster and support determination of the effects of climate variability and change. on the wave climate and the feedback influence of waves on the coupled earth climate system.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Explain why this combination of data and experiments is important.
