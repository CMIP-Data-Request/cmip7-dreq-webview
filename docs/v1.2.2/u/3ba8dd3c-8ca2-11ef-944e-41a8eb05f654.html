Air temperature is the bulk temperature of the air, not the surface (skin) temperature. The specification of a physical process by the phrase "due_to_" process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. "Orographic gravity waves" refer to gravity waves which are generated by flow over orography. The dissipation of gravity waves generates heating through an eddy heat flux convergence and through a viscous stress term. It is strongly recommended that a variable with this standard name should have the attribute units_metadata="temperature: difference", meaning that it refers to temperature differences and implying that the origin of the temperature scale is irrelevant, because it is essential to know whether a temperature is on-scale or a difference in order to convert the units correctly (cf. <a href="https://cfconventions.org/cf-conventions/cf-conventions.html#temperature-units" target="_blank">https://cfconventions.org/cf-conventions/cf-conventions.html#temperature-units</a>).</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>tendency_of_air_temperature_due_to_dissipation_of_orographic_gravity_waves</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>3ba8dd3c-8ca2-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>physical_parameters:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="5912b4e8-9e49-11e5-803c-0d0b866b59f3.html">tntogw (Temperature Tendency Due to Orographic Gravity Wave Dissipation)</a></li></ul></details><br><br><p><a href='../cf_standard_names.html'>Back to cf_standard_names</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
