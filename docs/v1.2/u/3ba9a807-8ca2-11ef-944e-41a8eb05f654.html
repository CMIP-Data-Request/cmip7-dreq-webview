Mole concentration means number of moles per unit volume, also called &quot;molarity&quot;, and is used in the construction &quot;mole_concentration_of_X_in_Y&quot;, where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical or biological species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as &quot;nitrogen&quot; or a phrase such as &quot;nox_expressed_as_nitrogen&quot;. The phrase &quot;expressed_as&quot; is used in the construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A. The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. Phytoplankton are algae that grow where there is sufficient light to support photosynthesis. &quot;Grazing of phytoplankton&quot; means the grazing of phytoplankton by zooplankton.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>tendency_of_mole_concentration_of_particulate_organic_matter_expressed_as_carbon_in_sea_water_due_to_grazing_of_phytoplankton</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>3ba9a807-8ca2-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>physical_parameters:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="28a54e8b5b73c4ae915a82ed99c74459.html">graz (Total Grazing of Phytoplankton by Zooplankton)</a></li></ul></details><br><br><p><a href='../cf_standard_names.html'>Back to cf_standard_names</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
