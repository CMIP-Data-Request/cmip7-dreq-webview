These goals map into both “Melting Ice and Global Consequences” and “Regional Sea-level Change” Grand Challenges relevant to CliC and the World Climate Research Program (WCRP). As uncertainties in future sea level arise due to both the climate forcing and the response of the ice sheets, a primary focus for ISMIP6 was to become better integrated in the CMIP6 initiative. ISMIP6 became an endorsed activity of CMIP6 in 2015 allowing ice sheets to be considered as a component of the Earth system for the first time in CMIP. ISMIP6 became a major model inter-comparison effort (with 36 international groups and over 60 participants) making process-based projections for the Sixth Assessment Report of the IPCC. 

ISMIP6 and ISMIP7 experimental protocols explore the uncertainty in sea level projections due to ice sheet model initialization as well as  ice sheet processes and parameters, climate scenario, and uncertainty in the representation of ice–ocean interactions on centennial timescales. ISMIP7 intends to continue working on two main themes. The first relates to dynamic ice sheets within global coupled climate models, while the second is based on outputs from climate models to force standalone ice sheet models (perhaps coupled to regional ocean and/or atmosphere models). We will thus have different protocols for each type of modeling activity, and these will be related by a common set of scenarios.  Similarly, ISMIP7 will continue to employ a working group structure to allow focus on climate forcing from the oceans and atmosphere, as well as links to the observational community.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='MIP Long Name'><strong>mip_long_name</strong></td><td>Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project for CMIP</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='URL to MIP website'><strong>mip_website</strong></td><td><a href="https://theghub.org/groups/ismip6/wiki" target="_blank">https://theghub.org/groups/ismip6/wiki</a></td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='MIP short name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>ISMIP7</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>527f5c73-8c97-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>opportunities:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="dafc73b8-8c95-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654.html">Ice sheet mass loss, contributions to sea level rise and freshwater flux input to the climate system</a></li></ul></details><br><br><details><summary><strong>variable_groups:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="dafc748a-8c95-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654.html">WaterResources_daily (Flood and drought risk assessment at daily timescale)</a></li><li><a href="dafc7409-8c95-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654.html">dynamical_downscaling_core (Dynamical Downscaling (CORDEX) core 6hourly)</a></li><li><a href="dafc740a-8c95-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654.html">dynamical_downscaling_ocean_core (Dynamical Downscaling Ocean (CORDEX) core)</a></li><li><a href="dafc7429-8c95-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654.html">landice_antarctica_allfreq (Variables for diagnosing Greenland ice sheet behaviour and climate interactions)</a></li><li><a href="dafc742b-8c95-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654.html">landice_global_allfreq (Variables for diagnosing ice sheet climate forcing and interactions)</a></li><li><a href="dafc742c-8c95-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654.html">landice_greenland_allfreq (Variables for diagnosing Greenland ice sheet behaviour and climate interactions)</a></li><li><a href="dafc7435-8c95-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654.html">ocean_temperature_extremes (Ocean surface temperature metrics collected on a daily frequency.)</a></li><li><a href="dafc7464-8c95-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654.html">sea_level_extremes (High-frequency surface variability)</a></li></ul></details><br><br><p><a href='../mips.html'>Back to mips</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
