The phrase &quot;minus_tendency&quot; means that the quantity described takes the opposite sign convention to that for the quantity which has the same standard name apart from this phrase, i.e. the two quantities differ from one another by a factor of -1. Thus a &quot;minus_tendency&quot; in the atmosphere means a positive deposition rate onto the underlying surface. &quot;Content&quot; indicates a quantity per unit area. The &quot;ocean content&quot; of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the bottom of the ocean. The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. &quot;Sedimentation&quot; is the sinking of particulate matter to the floor of a body of water. &quot;Inorganic carbon&quot; describes a family of chemical species and is the term used in standard names for all species belonging to the family that are represented within a given model. The list of individual species that are included in a quantity having a group chemical standard name can vary between models. Where possible, the data variable should be accompanied by a complete description of the species represented, for example, by using a comment attribute.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>minus_tendency_of_ocean_mole_content_of_inorganic_carbon_due_to_sedimentation</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>3ba74e26-8ca2-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>physical_parameters:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="e799552047be54bf13ccbe494c73cc81.html">fric (Downward Inorganic Carbon Flux at Ocean Bottom)</a></li></ul></details><br><br><p><a href='../cf_standard_names.html'>Back to cf_standard_names</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
