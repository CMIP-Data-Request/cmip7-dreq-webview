Since 1950, irrigation experienced rapid expansion, with the irrigated area almost tripling until the beginning of this century. There is no doubt that the expanded irrigation extent will intensify the irrigation-induced impacts, while there are few studies exploring how these impacts have evolved. Earth system models were widely used to address this question, in which the implementation of irrigation varies, which may introduce uncertainties. To have a better understanding of the irrigation-expansion-induced impacts, we launched a model intercomparison project, in which all models are required to run two experiments, one with transient irrigation extent and another one with the fixed irrigation extent at the year 1901. The outputs will be analyzed with various interests, including near-surface climate, global carbon exchange, labor productivity, etc.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='MIP Long Name'><strong>mip_long_name</strong></td><td>Irrigation Model Intercomparison Project</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='URL to MIP website'><strong>mip_website</strong></td><td><a href="https://hydr.vub.be/projects/irrmip" target="_blank">https://hydr.vub.be/projects/irrmip</a></td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='MIP short name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>IRRMIP</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>527f5c85-8c97-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>opportunities:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="dafc739a-8c95-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654.html">Assessments for Hydrological Processes, Water Resources, and Freshwater Systems</a></li></ul></details><br><p><a href='../mips.html'>Back to mips</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
