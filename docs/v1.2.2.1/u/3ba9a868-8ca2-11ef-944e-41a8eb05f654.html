The specification of a physical process by the phrase due_to_process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. Parameterized eddy advection in an ocean model means the part due to a scheme representing parameterized eddy-induced advective effects not included in the resolved model velocity field. Parameterized eddy advection can be represented on various spatial scales and there are standard names for parameterized_mesoscale_eddy_advection and parameterized_submesoscale_eddy_advection which both contribute to the total parameterized eddy advection. Additionally, when the parameterized advective process is represented in the model as a skew-diffusion rather than an advection, then the parameterized skew diffusion should be included in this diagnostic. The convergence of a skew-flux is identical (in the continuous formulation) to the convergence of an advective flux, making their tendencies the same.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>tendency_of_sea_water_salinity_expressed_as_salt_content_due_to_parameterized_eddy_advection</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>3ba9a868-8ca2-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>physical_parameters:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="f507e49404f47a6255539751483d8bdc.html">osaltpadvect (Tendency of Sea Water Salinity Expressed as Salt Content Due to Parameterized Eddy Advection)</a></li></ul></details><br><p><a href='../cf_standard_names.html'>Back to cf_standard_names</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
