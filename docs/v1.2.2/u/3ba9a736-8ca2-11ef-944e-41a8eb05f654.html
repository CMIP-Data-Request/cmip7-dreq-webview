Mole concentration means number of moles per unit volume, also called &quot;molarity&quot;, and is used in the construction &quot;mole_concentration_of_X_in_Y&quot;, where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical or biological species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as &quot;nitrogen&quot; or a phrase such as &quot;nox_expressed_as_nitrogen&quot;. The chemical formula for nitrous oxide is N2O. The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. &quot;Chemical destruction&quot; means the result of all chemical reactions within the medium (here, atmosphere) that remove a certain amount of a particular species from the medium.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>tendency_of_atmosphere_mole_concentration_of_nitrous_oxide_due_to_chemical_destruction</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>3ba9a736-8ca2-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>physical_parameters:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="2b133ea2-1b42-11e6-a696-35cd2d8034df.html">lossn2o (Monthly Loss of Atmospheric Nitrous Oxide)</a></li></ul></details><br><br><p><a href='../cf_standard_names.html'>Back to cf_standard_names</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
