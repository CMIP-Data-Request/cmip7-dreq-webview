Climate resilience and efficiency of transport infrastructure can also have impacts on mitigation efforts given its role on current emissions.
</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Explain why this combination of data and experiments is important. How will it contribute to CMIP objectives?'><strong>expected_impacts</strong></td><td>The variables requested under this opportunity support studies focused on the impacts of climate change on the transport sector (railways and road, mainly). The sector is severely impacted by extreme weather events, through multiple hazards such as heat, flooding, extreme winds, coastal erosion and storm surges. Future climate projections are used to inform business planning, adaptation and regulatory submissions by the transport infrastructure sector. 
This is supported by substantial work in the topic focused on different regions of the world. A few examples listed below:
