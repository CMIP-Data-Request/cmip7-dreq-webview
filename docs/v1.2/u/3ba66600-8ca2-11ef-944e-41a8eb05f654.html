The radiative flux is reduced by a factor exp(-&quot;optical_thickness&quot;) on traversing the path. A coordinate variable of radiation_wavelength or radiation_frequency can be specified to indicate that the optical thickness applies at specific wavelengths or frequencies. The atmosphere optical thickness applies to radiation passing through the entire atmosphere. &quot;Aerosol&quot; means the system of suspended liquid or solid particles in air (except cloud droplets) and their carrier gas, the air itself. &quot;Ambient_aerosol&quot; means that the aerosol is measured or modelled at the ambient state of pressure, temperature and relative humidity that exists in its immediate environment. &quot;Ambient aerosol particles&quot; are aerosol particles that have taken up ambient water through hygroscopic growth. The extent of hygroscopic growth depends on the relative humidity and the composition of the particles. To specify the relative humidity and temperature at which the quantity described by the standard name applies, provide scalar coordinate variables with standard names of &quot;relative_humidity&quot; and &quot;air_temperature&quot;. The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>atmosphere_optical_thickness_due_to_sulfate_ambient_aerosol_particles</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>3ba66600-8ca2-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>physical_parameters:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="b9ca453bfa3c606401892e5768ca7d6c.html">od550so4 (Sulfate Aerosol Optical Depth at 550nm)</a></li></ul></details><br><br><p><a href='../cf_standard_names.html'>Back to cf_standard_names</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
