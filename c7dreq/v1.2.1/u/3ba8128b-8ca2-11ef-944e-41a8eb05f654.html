However, the unqualified term &#x27;salinity&#x27; is generic and does not necessarily imply any particular method of calculation. The units of salinity are dimensionless and the units attribute should normally be given as 1e-3 or 0.001 i.e. parts per thousand. Sea surface salinity is often abbreviated as &quot;SSS&quot;. For the salinity of sea water at a particular depth or layer, a data variable of &quot;sea_water_salinity&quot; or one of the more precisely defined salinities should be used with a vertical coordinate axis. There are standard names for the precisely defined salinity quantities: sea_water_knudsen_salinity, S_K (used for salinity observations between 1901 and 1966), sea_water_cox_salinity, S_C (used for salinity observations between 1967 and 1977), sea_water_practical_salinity, S_P (used for salinity observations from 1978 to the present day), sea_water_absolute_salinity, S_A, sea_water_preformed_salinity, S_*, and sea_water_reference_salinity. Practical Salinity is reported on the Practical Salinity Scale of 1978 (PSS-78), and is usually based on the electrical conductivity of sea water in observations since the 1960s. Conversion of data between the observed scales follows: S_P = (S_K - 0.03) * (1.80655 / 1.805) and S_P = S_C, however the accuracy of the latter is dependent on whether chlorinity or conductivity was used to determine the S_C value, with this inconsistency driving the development of PSS-78. The more precise standard names should be used where appropriate for both modelled and observed salinities. In particular, the use of sea_water_salinity to describe salinity observations made from 1978 onwards is now deprecated in favor of the term sea_water_practical_salinity which is the salinity quantity stored by national data centers for post-1978 observations. The only exception to this is where the observed salinities are definitely known not to be recorded on the Practical Salinity Scale. The unit &quot;parts per thousand&quot; was used for sea_water_knudsen_salinity and sea_water_cox_salinity.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>sea_surface_salinity</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>3ba8128b-8ca2-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>physical_parameters:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="74a9891bcab2667dbcb66574c6370c86.html">sos (Sea Surface Salinity)</a></li><li><a href="d4ee4806-b00f-11e6-a1f0-ac72891c3257.html">sosga (Global Average Sea Surface Salinity)</a></li></ul></details><br><p><a href='../cf_standard_names.html'>Back to cf_standard_names</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
