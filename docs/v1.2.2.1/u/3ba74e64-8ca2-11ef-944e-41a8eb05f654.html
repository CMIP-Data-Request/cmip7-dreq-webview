A chemical species or biological group denoted by X may be described by a single term such as &quot;nitrogen&quot; or a phrase such as &quot;nox_expressed_as_nitrogen&quot;. The phrase &quot;expressed_as&quot; is used in the construction &quot;A_expressed_as_B&quot;, where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A. Phytoplankton are algae that grow where there is sufficient light to support photosynthesis. Diazotrophic phytoplankton are phytoplankton (predominantly from Phylum Cyanobacteria) that are able to fix molecular nitrogen (gas or solute) in addition to nitrate and ammonium.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>mole_concentration_of_diazotrophic_phytoplankton_expressed_as_carbon_in_sea_water</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>3ba74e64-8ca2-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>physical_parameters:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="ad7df7199759ad25164da83e37a6da17.html">phydiaz (Mole Concentration of Diazotrophs Expressed as Carbon in Sea Water)</a></li><li><a href="c96cefb8-c5f0-11e6-ac20-5404a60d96b5.html">phydiazos (Surface Mole Concentration of Diazotrophs Expressed as Carbon in Sea Water)</a></li></ul></details><br><p><a href='../cf_standard_names.html'>Back to cf_standard_names</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
