The list of individual species that are included in a quantity having a group chemical standard name can vary between models. Where possible, the data variable should be accompanied by a complete description of the species represented, for example, by using a comment attribute. Standard names that use the term &quot;brox&quot; are used for quantities that contain all inorganic bromine species except HBr and BrONO2.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>mole_fraction_of_inorganic_bromine_in_air</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>3ba74f47-8ca2-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>physical_parameters:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="96a44ea6-b096-11e6-aab6-ac72891c3257.html">bry (Total Inorganic Bromine Volume Mixing Ratio)</a></li></ul></details><br><p><a href='../cf_standard_names.html'>Back to cf_standard_names</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
