The phrase &quot;expressed_as&quot; is used in the construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A. The chemical formula for carbon dioxide is CO2. &quot;Content&quot; indicates a quantity per unit area. The &quot;atmosphere content&quot; of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the atmosphere. For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard names including &quot;content_of_atmosphere_layer&quot; are used. The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. &quot;Emission&quot; means emission from a primary source located anywhere within the atmosphere, including at the lower boundary (i.e. the surface of the earth). &quot;Emission&quot; is a process entirely distinct from &quot;re-emission&quot; which is used in some standard names. Examples of &quot;forestry and agricultural products&quot; are paper, cardboard, furniture, timber for construction, biofuels and food for both humans and livestock. Models that simulate land use changes have one or more pools of carbon that represent these products in order to conserve carbon and allow its eventual release into the atmosphere, for example, when the products decompose in landfill sites.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>tendency_of_atmosphere_mass_content_of_carbon_dioxide_expressed_as_carbon_due_to_emission_from_forestry_and_agricultural_products</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>3ba8dd8e-8ca2-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>physical_parameters:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="590f933a-9e49-11e5-803c-0d0b866b59f3.html">fProductDecomp (Decomposition out of Product Pools to CO2 in Atmosphere as Carbon Mass Flux [kgC m-2 s-1])</a></li></ul></details><br><p><a href='../cf_standard_names.html'>Back to cf_standard_names</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
