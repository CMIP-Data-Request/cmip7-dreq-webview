The idea is to evaluate and benchmark the newly available simulations as soon as they are uploaded to ESGF with metrics and diagnostics that are available through different open-source evaluation and benchmarking tools. The REF is envisioned to be available already for AR7 Fast-Track simulations, however, the available metrics and diagnostics will be limited to a temporal resolution of monthly mean data and a community selection of of about five metrics/diagnostics per realm. Results will be publicly displayed for the community to see.
</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Explain why this combination of data and experiments is important. How will it contribute to CMIP objectives?'><strong>expected_impacts</strong></td><td>The suggested metrics/diagnostics for the REF to be available for the AR7 Fast-Track simulations are in a first instance very basic evaluations and are not expected to require very specific variables. However, the impact of the publicly available evaluation and benchmarking results should be big since the community can get a quick overview of available simulations and their characteristics that might be interesting for different applications and analyses.
