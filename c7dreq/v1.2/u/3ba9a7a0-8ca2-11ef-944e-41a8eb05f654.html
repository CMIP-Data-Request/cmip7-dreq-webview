Wind is defined as a two-dimensional (horizontal) air velocity vector, with no vertical component. (Vertical motion in the atmosphere has the standard name &quot;upward_air_velocity&quot;). The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. The &quot;Transformed Eulerian Mean&quot; refers to a formulation of the mean equations which incorporates some eddy terms into the definition of the mean, described in Andrews et al (1987): Middle Atmospheric Dynamics.
