In the future, land-use activities are likely to expand and intensify further to meet growing demands for food, fiber, and energy. The Land Use Model Intercomparison Project (LUMIP) aims to further advance understanding of the impacts of land-use and land-cover change (LULCC) on climate, specifically addressing the following questions. (1) What are the effects of LULCC on climate and biogeochemical cycling (past–future)? (2) What are the impacts of land management on surface fluxes of carbon, water, and energy, and are there regional land-management strategies with the promise to help mitigate climate change? In addressing these questions, LUMIP will also address a range of more detailed science questions to get at process-level attribution, uncertainty, data requirements, and other related issues in more depth and sophistication than possible in a multi-model context to date. There will be particular focus on the separation and quantification of the effects on climate from LULCC relative to all forcings, separation of biogeochemical from biogeophysical effects of land use, the unique impacts of land-cover change vs. land-management change, modulation of land-use impact on climate by land–atmosphere coupling strength, and the extent to which impacts of enhanced CO2 concentrations on plant photosynthesis are modulated by past and future land use.

LUMIP involves three major sets of science activities: (1) development of an updated and expanded historical and future land-use data set, (2) an experimental protocol for specific LUMIP experiments for CMIP6, and (3) definition of metrics and diagnostic protocols that quantify model performance, and related sensitivities, with respect to LULCC. In this paper, we describe LUMIP activity (2), i.e., the LUMIP simulations that will formally be part of CMIP6. These experiments are explicitly designed to be complementary to simulations requested in the CMIP6 DECK and historical simulations and other CMIP6 MIPs including ScenarioMIP, C4MIP, LS3MIP, and DAMIP. LUMIP includes a two-phase experimental design. Phase one features idealized coupled and land-only model simulations designed to advance process-level understanding of LULCC impacts on climate, as well as to quantify model sensitivity to potential land-cover and land-use change. Phase two experiments focus on quantification of the historic impact of land use and the potential for future land management decisions to aid in mitigation of climate change. This paper documents these simulations in detail, explains their rationale, outlines plans for analysis, and describes a new subgrid land-use tile data request for selected variables (reporting model output data separately for primary and secondary land, crops, pasture, and urban land-use types). It is essential that modeling groups participating in LUMIP adhere to the experimental design as closely as possible and clearly report how the model experiments were executed.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='MIP Long Name'><strong>mip_long_name</strong></td><td>Land-Use Model Intercomparison Project</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='URL to MIP website'><strong>mip_website</strong></td><td><a href="https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/projects/cmip6/lumip" target="_blank">https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/projects/cmip6/lumip</a></td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='MIP short name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>LUMIP</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>527f5c77-8c97-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>opportunities:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="dafc73bd-8c95-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654.html">Accurate assessment of land-atmosphere coupling</a></li><li><a href="dafc73c2-8c95-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654.html">Land use change</a></li><li><a href="dafc73bc-8c95-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654.html">Plant Phenology</a></li></ul></details><br><details><summary><strong>variable_groups:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="dafc73d0-8c95-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654.html">AgLandUse (Agricultural land use)</a></li><li><a href="dafc73d4-8c95-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654.html">AgTile (Agricultural tile)</a></li><li><a href="dafc7428-8c95-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654.html">landatm_coupling_3hA (Land-Atmosphere Coupling at 3 h time means or at an instantaneous point 3 hPt)</a></li><li><a href="80ab723b-a698-11ef-914a-613c0433d878.html">landatm_coupling_3hr_medium (Land-Atmosphere Coupling at 3 h time means or at an instantaneous point 3 hPt (medium priority))</a></li><li><a href="dafc742d-8c95-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654.html">landuse (Land use information including land use fractions and subgrid output on land use tiles at monthly and yearly timescales)</a></li></ul></details><br><p><a href='../mips.html'>Back to mips</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
