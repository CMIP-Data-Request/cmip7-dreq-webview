The phrase &quot;tendency_of_X&quot; means derivative of X with respect to time. The surface called &quot;surface&quot; means the lower boundary of the atmosphere. The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. &quot;Mass balance&quot; means the net rate at which ice is added. A negative value means loss of ice. The tendency in ice mass due to the surface mass balance is the spatial integral of the quantity with standard name land_ice_surface_specific_mass_balance_flux. The horizontal domain over which the quantity is described by the associated coordinate variables and coordinate bounds or by a string valued coordinate variable or scalar coordinate variable with a standard name of &quot;region&quot;.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>tendency_of_land_ice_mass_due_to_surface_mass_balance</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>3ba9a7af-8ca2-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>physical_parameters:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="4146943a-4f40-11e6-a814-ac72891c3257.html">tendacabf (Total Surface Mass Balance Flux)</a></li></ul></details><br><p><a href='../cf_standard_names.html'>Back to cf_standard_names</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
