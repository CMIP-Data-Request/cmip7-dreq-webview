Increasing the time resolution of model output describing components of land–atmosphere coupling and processes within the land–atmosphere interface is essential to fully and accurately model, understand, and predict these processes and to compare modeled processes with observational datasets. The data request described here will allow us to compare coupled Earth system and climate models with observations from field campaigns and to compare both diurnal and long-term properties of L–A interactions in different models and during model development.

</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Explain why this combination of data and experiments is important. How will it contribute to CMIP objectives?'><strong>expected_impacts</strong></td><td>Local L–A coupling (LoCo) metrics capture relevant L–A processes, highlighting the impact of soil and vegetation states on surface flux partitioning and the impact of surface fluxes on boundary layer (BL) growth and development and the entrainment of air above the BL. 

Higher-frequency model output will (i) allow for more direct comparison with observational field campaigns on process-relevant timescales, (ii) enable demonstration of inter-model spread in L–A coupling processes, and (iii) aid in targeted identification of sources of deficiencies and opportunities for improvement of the models.
