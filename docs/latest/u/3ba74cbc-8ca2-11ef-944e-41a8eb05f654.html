A chemical species or biological group denoted by X may be described by a single term such as &quot;nitrogen&quot; or a phrase such as &quot;nox_expressed_as_nitrogen&quot;. The phrase &quot;expressed_as&quot; is used in the construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A. Chlorophylls are the green pigments found in most plants, algae and cyanobacteria; their presence is essential for photosynthesis to take place. There are several different forms of chlorophyll that occur naturally. All contain a chlorin ring (chemical formula C20H16N4) which gives the green pigment and a side chain whose structure varies. The naturally occurring forms of chlorophyll contain between 35 and 55 carbon atoms. Phytoplankton are algae that grow where there is sufficient light to support photosynthesis. Diazotrophic phytoplankton are phytoplankton (predominantly from Phylum Cyanobacteria) that are able to fix molecular nitrogen (gas or solute) in addition to nitrate and ammonium.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>mass_concentration_of_diazotrophic_phytoplankton_expressed_as_chlorophyll_in_sea_water</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>3ba74cbc-8ca2-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>physical_parameters:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="171d617ceca8a4351f53d090c0ead89c.html">chldiaz (Mass Concentration of Diazotrophs Expressed as Chlorophyll in Sea Water)</a></li><li><a href="c96e19b0-c5f0-11e6-ac20-5404a60d96b5.html">chldiazos (Surface Mass Concentration of Diazotrophs Expressed as Chlorophyll in Sea Water)</a></li></ul></details><br><br><p><a href='../cf_standard_names.html'>Back to cf_standard_names</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
