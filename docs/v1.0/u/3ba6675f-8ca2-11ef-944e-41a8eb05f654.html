The actual radar reflectivity factor would depend on the size distribution and composition of the particles within the target volume and these are often unknown. &quot;histogram_of_X[_over_Z]&quot; means histogram (i.e. number of counts for each  range of X) of variations (over Z) of X. The data variable should have an axis for X. A reference ellipsoid is a regular mathematical figure that approximates the irregular shape of the geoid. A number of reference ellipsoids are defined for use in the field of geodesy. The geoid is a surface of constant geopotential with which mean sea level would coincide if the ocean were at rest. To specify which reference ellipsoid is being used, a grid_mapping variable should be attached to the data variable as described in Chapter 5.6 of the CF Convention.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>histogram_of_equivalent_reflectivity_factor_over_height_above_reference_ellipsoid</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>3ba6675f-8ca2-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>physical_parameters:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="5a6730cdd3fef77dc53ea1f61b23821f.html">cfadDbze94 (CloudSat Radar Reflectivity CFAD)</a></li></ul></details><br><p><a href='../cf_standard_names.html'>Back to cf_standard_names</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
