"tendency_of_X" means derivative of X with respect to time. "longwave" means longwave radiation. Air temperature is the bulk temperature of the air, not the surface (skin) temperature. It is strongly recommended that a variable with this standard name should have the attribute units_metadata="temperature: difference", meaning that it refers to temperature differences and implying that the origin of the temperature scale is irrelevant, because it is essential to know whether a temperature is on-scale or a difference in order to convert the units correctly (cf. <a href="https://cfconventions.org/cf-conventions/cf-conventions.html#temperature-units" target="_blank">https://cfconventions.org/cf-conventions/cf-conventions.html#temperature-units</a>).</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>tendency_of_air_temperature_due_to_longwave_heating</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>3ba8dd3e-8ca2-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>physical_parameters:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="5917483c-9e49-11e5-803c-0d0b866b59f3.html">tntrl (Tendency of Air Temperature Due to Longwave Radiative Heating)</a></li></ul></details><br><p><a href='../cf_standard_names.html'>Back to cf_standard_names</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
