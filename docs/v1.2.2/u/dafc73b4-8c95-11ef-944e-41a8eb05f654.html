Fundamentally, all anthropogenically-induced climate change is a response to the energy imbalance caused by the radiative forcing. Therefore, the systematic diagnosis of radiative forcing in climate models is crucial for interpreting projections of climate change, evaluating the climate impacts of proposed emission reduction strategies, and for understanding and ultimately reducing climate model uncertainty. The opportunity is dedicated to quantifying the total or &quot;effective&quot; radiative forcing in CMIP simulations, along with its components such as the instantaneous radiative forcing and radiative adjustments. The contents of the opportunity will enable users to employ common, well-established methods for diagnosing radiative forcing globally and is particularly relevant for participation in the Radiative Forcing Model Intercomparison Project (RFMIP). The request consists entirely of monthly output, mostly for standard variables that are also included in the CMIP7 Baseline data request.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Explain why this combination of data and experiments is important. How will it contribute to CMIP objectives?'><strong>expected_impacts</strong></td><td>The data and experiments referenced in this opportunity will enable a comprehensive diagnosis of radiative forcing in CMIP7, which is key for model evaluation and scientific understanding. For example, the radiative fluxes can be directly used to estimate the effective radiative forcing in fixed-SST or, when combined with regression techniques, in fully coupled simulations. Then, radiation diagnostic tools like radiative kernels can be applied to the output of the atmospheric state (e.g. temperature, humidity) to further decompose the effective radiative forcing and understand its physical drivers and sources of uncertainty.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Explain how the data products requested map onto the expected outcomes. Include reference to the level of resources that will be needed to support this request and why they are proportionate to the expected impact.'><strong>justification_of_resources</strong></td><td>Given its focus on low-frequency output, this opportunity will not be burdensome to data providers and will provide a considerable return on investment, considering that the diagnosis of radiative forcing is fundamental to a variety of science applications.  Furthermore, three experiments now required as part of the DECK (piClim-control, piClim-4xCO2, piClim-anthro) are designed for radiative forcing diagnosis and will serve little scientific value without the output contained in this opportunity.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Lead theme will coordinate communication and actions for the Opportunity'><strong>lead_theme</strong></td><td><span><a href="527f5c90-8c97-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654.html">Atmosphere</a></span></td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Default ensemble size, excluding multiple start times.
