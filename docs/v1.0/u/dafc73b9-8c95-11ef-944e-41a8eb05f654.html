These include studies of cloud, precipitation, and circulation processes, feedbacks, and rapid adjustments, model evaluation against observations, climate sensitivity, and pattern effects This &quot;CFMIP-amip-amip4K&quot; flavor of the broader CFMIP opportunity is intended to capture variables crucial for detailed evaluation of models against observations (including COSP output) and for process-level studies from two experiments (amip and amip-p4K).
</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Explain why this combination of data and experiments is important. How will it contribute to CMIP objectives?'><strong>expected_impacts</strong></td><td>This opportunity addresses the three primary objectives of CFMIP:
A) Advance diagnosis and understanding of cloud feedbacks and rapid cloud adjustments in past, present and future climates.
B) Assess representations of clouds, their radiative properties, and their feedback mechanisms in climate models to inform model development.
C) Understand and evaluate other aspects of climate change that depend on cloud processes, such as climate sensitivity, circulation and precipitation, regional patterns and extremes, and nonlinear behaviour.

This opportunity will facilitate the community&#x27;s ability to answer the key science questions of CFMIP:
1) What are the physical mechanisms underlying cloud feedbacks and rapid adjustments in nature, and how credibly do models represent these?
2) How and why do cloud feedbacks and adjustments depend on the nature of the climate forcing?
3) How and why do cloud feedbacks and adjustments depend on climate base state?
4) What coupled processes underlie the SST pattern effect, and how and why does this affect cloud feedback?
5) What are the mechanisms underlying cloud-circulation coupling and regional precipitation change, and how credibly do models represent these?

Despite the large number of requested fields variables, some of which are at sub-monthly and 3D resolution, these data re requested for only 2 experiments (amip and amip-p4K). Also, the sub-hourly data is requested only at select cfSites locations.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Lead theme will coordinate communication and actions for the Opportunity'><strong>lead_theme</strong></td><td><span><a href="527f5c90-8c97-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654.html">Atmosphere</a></span></td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Default ensemble size, excluding multiple start times.
