In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, &quot;flux&quot; implies per unit area, called &quot;flux density&quot; in physics. The specification of a physical process by the phrase due_to_process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. &quot;Sea ice thermodynamics&quot; refers to the addition or subtraction of mass due to surface and basal fluxes, i.e., due to melting, sublimation and fusion. &quot;Sea ice&quot; means all ice floating in the sea which has formed from freezing sea water, rather than by other processes such as calving of land ice to form icebergs.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>virtual_salt_flux_into_sea_water_due_to_sea_ice_thermodynamics</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>3ba9a92c-8ca2-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>physical_parameters:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="d0c290e7deb148591b62f8f050a885c2.html">vsfsit (Virtual Salt Flux into Sea Water Due to Sea Ice Thermodynamics)</a></li></ul></details><br><p><a href='../cf_standard_names.html'>Back to cf_standard_names</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
