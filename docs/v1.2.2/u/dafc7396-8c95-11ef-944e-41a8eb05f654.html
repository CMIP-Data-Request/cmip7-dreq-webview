The opportunity thus supports a broad set of use cases to model the positive and negative contributions of Nature to people.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Explain how the data products requested map onto the expected outcomes.

This will directly contribute to the efforts of IPBES to improve understanding of biodiversity and ecosystem services changes and improve scenario work.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Lead theme will coordinate communication and actions for the Opportunity'><strong>lead_theme</strong></td><td><span><a href="527f5c8f-8c97-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654.html">Impacts &amp; Adaptation</a></span></td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Default ensemble size, excluding multiple start times.
