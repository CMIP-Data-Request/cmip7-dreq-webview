The canopy is often considered to be the outer surfaces of the vegetation. Plant height and the distribution, orientation and shape of plant leaves within a canopy influence the atmospheric environment and many plant processes within the canopy. Reference: AMS Glossary http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Canopy. The surface_albedo restricted to the area type &quot;vegetation&quot; is related to canopy_albedo, but the former also includes the effect of radiation being reflected from the ground underneath the canopy.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>canopy_albedo</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>3ba6662a-8ca2-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>physical_parameters:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="590e736a-9e49-11e5-803c-0d0b866b59f3.html">albc (Canopy Albedo)</a></li></ul></details><br><p><a href='../cf_standard_names.html'>Back to cf_standard_names</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
