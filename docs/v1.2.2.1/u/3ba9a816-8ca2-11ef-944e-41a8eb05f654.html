Wind is defined as a two-dimensional (horizontal) air velocity vector, with no vertical component. (Vertical motion in the atmosphere has the standard name &quot;upward_air_velocity&quot;). The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. &quot;Nonorographic&quot; gravity waves refer to gravity waves which are not generated by flow over orography. The quantity with standard name tendency_of_northward_wind_due_to_gravity_wave_drag is the total tendency of the northward wind due to gravity waves. It is the sum of the tendencies due to orographic and nonorographic gravity waves which have the standard names tendency_of_northward_wind_due_to_orographic_gravity_wave_drag and tendency_of_northward_wind_due_to_nonorographic_gravity_wave_drag, respectively.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>tendency_of_northward_wind_due_to_nonorographic_gravity_wave_drag</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>3ba9a816-8ca2-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>physical_parameters:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="59170700-9e49-11e5-803c-0d0b866b59f3.html">vtendnogw (Northward Acceleration Due to Non-Orographic Gravity Wave Drag)</a></li></ul></details><br><p><a href='../cf_standard_names.html'>Back to cf_standard_names</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
