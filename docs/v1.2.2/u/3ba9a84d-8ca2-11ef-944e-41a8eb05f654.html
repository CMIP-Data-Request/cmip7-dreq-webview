It is evaluated as the area of interest divided by the grid cell area. Sea ice area fraction is area of the sea surface occupied by sea ice. It is also called &quot;sea ice concentration&quot;. &quot;Sea ice&quot; means all ice floating in the sea which has formed from freezing sea water, rather than by other processes such as calving of land ice to form icebergs. The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. &quot;Sea ice thermodynamics&quot; refers to the addition or subtraction of mass due to surface and basal fluxes.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>tendency_of_sea_ice_area_fraction_due_to_thermodynamics</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>3ba9a84d-8ca2-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>physical_parameters:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="590dc60e-9e49-11e5-803c-0d0b866b59f3.html">sidconcth (Sea-Ice Area Fraction Tendency Due to Thermodynamics)</a></li></ul></details><br><p><a href='../cf_standard_names.html'>Back to cf_standard_names</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
