Ideally these variables could be provided at subdaily timescale as some high-impact hydrometeorological hazards such as flash flooding occur at very short timescale.
- Variables requested in the WaterResources\_daily**, **WaterResources\_monthly and** **WaterResources\_subdaily are a smaller range of variables (precipitation and PET) for hydrological simulations, using bucket-type/watershed models. For the subdaily set of variables, we request in extra for hourly precipitation as it is shown to be able to enable more robust hydrological simulations (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214581823002756?via%3Dihub#da0005" target="_blank">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214581823002756?via%3Dihub#da0005</a>).
- Variables requested in the impact\_energy\_hydropower are used for hydropower modelling applications.
- Variables requested in the biodiv\_freshwater\_daily variable group are used in process-explicit as well as statistical biodiversity and ecosystem models. These span models for predicting spatiotemporal distribution and abundances of species or functional types, to models of fish migration and disease spread. This variable group thus supports a broad set of use  cases to model the positive and negative contributions of Nature to people.
- PET calculation variable groups are useful for the validation of  evspsblpot and to calculate potential evapotranspiration from raw variables.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Explain how the data products requested map onto the expected outcomes.

Freshwater ecosystems have experienced the most severe habitat degradation and losses in biodiversity and require urgent actions to halt biodiversity loss and restore ecosystem health. Improved freshwater biodiversity and ecosystem modelling based on high resolution climatic predictors will directly contribute to the efforts of IPBES to improve understanding of biodiversity and ecosystem services  changes and improve scenario work.
Due to the highly uncertain nature of and strong internal variability affecting precipitation simulated by the models, large ensemble simulations are needed to capture the plausible range of variability which is crucial for risk assessment for water resources and ensures well-informed adaptation actions.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Lead theme will coordinate communication and actions for the Opportunity'><strong>lead_theme</strong></td><td><span><a href="527f5c8f-8c97-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654.html">Impacts &amp; Adaptation</a></span></td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Default ensemble size, excluding multiple start times.
