The phrase &quot;expressed_as&quot; is used in the construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A. &quot;Nitrogen compounds&quot; summarizes all chemical species containing nitrogen atoms. &quot;Litter&quot; is dead plant material in or above the soil. It is distinct from coarse wood debris. The precise distinction between &quot;fine&quot; and &quot;coarse&quot; is model dependent. The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. Remineralization is the degradation of organic matter into inorganic forms of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and other micronutrients, which consumes oxygen and releases energy. Immobilisation of nitrogen refers to retention of nitrogen by micro-organisms under certain conditions, making it unavailable for plants.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>mass_flux_of_nitrogen_compounds_expressed_as_nitrogen_out_of_litter_and_soil_due_to_immobilisation_and_remineralization</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>3ba74d5b-8ca2-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>physical_parameters:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="590dda36-9e49-11e5-803c-0d0b866b59f3.html">fNnetmin (Net Nitrogen Release from Soil and Litter as the Outcome of Nitrogen Immobilisation and Gross Mineralisation)</a></li></ul></details><br><br><p><a href='../cf_standard_names.html'>Back to cf_standard_names</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
