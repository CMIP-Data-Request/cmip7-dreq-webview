This is unlike any prior MIP, where the focus has been on changes in global emissions and/or very idealized aerosol experiments. Perturbing regional emissions makes RAMIP novel from a scientific standpoint, and links the intended analyses more directly to mitigation and adaptation policy issues. From a science perspective, there is limited information on how realistic regional aerosol emissions impact local as well as remote climate conditions. RAMIP will enable an evaluation of the full range of potential influences of realistic and regionally varied aerosol emission changes on near-future climate. From the policy perspective, RAMIP addresses the burning question of how local and remote decisions affecting emissions of aerosols influence climate change in any given region. RAMIP will provide the information needed to make direct links between regional climate policies and regional climate change.

RAMIP experiments are designed to explore sensitivities to aerosol type and location, and provide improved constraints on uncertainties driven by aerosol radiative forcing and the dynamical response to aerosol changes. The core experiments will assess the effects of differences in future global and regional (East Asia, South Asia, Africa and the Middle East, Europe and North America) aerosol emission trajectories through 2051, while optional experiments will test the nonlinear effects of varying emission location and aerosol types along this future trajectory. All experiments are based on the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways, and are intended to be performed with sixth Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) generation models, initialised from the CMIP6 historical experiments, to facilitate comparisons with existing projections. Requested outputs will enable analysis of the role of aerosol in near-future changes in, for example, temperature and precipitation means and extremes, storms, air quality, monsoons, ocean circulation, and modes of variability.

RAMIP is closely related to AerChemMIP, especially the SSP3-7.0-lowNTCF simulation, but RAMIP focusses on the response to regional emission changes. As many of the key responses will also be regional in nature, RAMIP requests at least 10 ensemble members per experiment, which is far more than were typically produced for AerChemMIP experiments. Both MIPs use an SSP3-7.0 baseline for future experiments. However, the aerosol reductions considered in AerChemMIP’s SSP3-7.0-lowNTCF are global, and moderate in rate and magnitude compared to RAMIP where regional emission perturbations follow SSP1-2.6: aerosol emission rates in SSP3-7.0-lowNTCF are still higher in 2100 than the 2050 emission rates in the RAMIP experiments. The distinct scientific questions and regional focus of RAMIP, the RAMIP requirement for 10 ensemble members, and the potential for confusion about future emission pathways, justify RAMIP remaining independent of AerChemMIP. As RAMIP focusses only on the response to aerosol changes, it does not have the emphasis on interactive chemistry that was a core part of AerChemMIP, which opens participation to a wider range of models.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='MIP Long Name'><strong>mip_long_name</strong></td><td>Regional Aerosol Model Intercomparison Project</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='URL to MIP website'><strong>mip_website</strong></td><td><a href="https://ramip.uk/" target="_blank">https://ramip.uk/</a></td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='MIP short name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>RAMIP</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>527f5c82-8c97-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>variable_groups:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="dafc73c4-8c95-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654.html">aerchemmip_2d_daily (2D trace gas, aerosol and climate variables at daily timescales for use in AerChemMIP2)</a></li><li><a href="dafc73c6-8c95-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654.html">aerchemmip_2d_subdaily (Surface and atmospheric fields at sub-daily timescales for analysis in AerChemMIP, including air quality and climate responses to SLCFs)</a></li><li><a href="dafc73c8-8c95-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654.html">aerchemmip_3d_daily (3D winds and ozone data at daily timescales for analysis in AerChemMIP2)</a></li></ul></details><br><br><p><a href='../mips.html'>Back to mips</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
