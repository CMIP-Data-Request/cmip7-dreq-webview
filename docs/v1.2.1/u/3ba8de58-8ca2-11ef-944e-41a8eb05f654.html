The &quot;atmosphere content&quot; of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the atmosphere. For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard names including &quot;content_of_atmosphere_layer&quot; are used. The mass is the total mass of the molecules. The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. &quot;Emission&quot; means emission from a primary source located anywhere within the atmosphere, including at the lower boundary (i.e. the surface of the earth). &quot;Emission&quot; is a process entirely distinct from &quot;re-emission&quot; which is used in some standard names. &quot;tendency_of_X&quot; means derivative of X with respect to time. &quot;nmvoc&quot; means non methane volatile organic compounds; &quot;nmvoc&quot; is the term used in standard names to describe the group of chemical species having this classification that are represented within a given model. The list of individual species that are included in a quantity having a group chemical standard name can vary between models. Where possible, the data variable should be accompanied by a complete description of the species represented, for example, by using a comment attribute.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>tendency_of_atmosphere_mass_content_of_nmvoc_due_to_emission</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>3ba8de58-8ca2-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>physical_parameters:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="8198a7882dd91603f07b93e929ccdbd0.html">emivoc (Total Emission Rate of NMVOC)</a></li></ul></details><br><br><p><a href='../cf_standard_names.html'>Back to cf_standard_names</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
