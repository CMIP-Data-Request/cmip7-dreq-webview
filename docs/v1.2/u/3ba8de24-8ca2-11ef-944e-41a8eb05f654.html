The &quot;atmosphere content&quot; of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the atmosphere. For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard names including content_of_atmosphere_layer are used.  The specification of a physical process by the phrase due_to_process means that the quantity named is a  single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity  named by omitting the phrase.  &quot;tendency_of_X&quot; means derivative of X with respect to time.  &quot;Emission&quot; means emission from a primary source located anywhere within the atmosphere, including at the lower boundary (i.e. earth&#x27;s surface). &quot;Emission&quot; is a process entirely distinct from &quot;re-emission&quot; which is used in some standard names. The chemical formula for methane is CH4. Methane is a member of the group of hydrocarbons known as alkanes.  There are standard names for the alkane group as well as for some of the individual species.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>tendency_of_atmosphere_mass_content_of_methane_due_to_emission</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>3ba8de24-8ca2-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>physical_parameters:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="f86eb67c-8ca1-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654.html">emiach4 (Anthropogenic emission rate of CH4)</a></li><li><a href="f86eb68e-8ca1-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654.html">emich4 (Total emission rate of CH4)</a></li></ul></details><br><br><p><a href='../cf_standard_names.html'>Back to cf_standard_names</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
