The mass loss from these ice sheets is a key contributor to future sea level rise, and their freshwater input to the climate system provides an important forcing for ocean circulation and carbon and heat uptake. Ice sheets are also a key potential tipping element in the Earth System, and characterising this aspect of their future evolution may have huge societal impact. This Opportunity comes from the ice sheet modelling community via ISMIP7 but other MIPs concerned with ice sheet behaviour, primarily TIPMIP and MISOMIP may use these variables. It requests climate model variables that characterise the boundaries of ice sheet regions from the atmosphere, land and ocean domains, as well as ice sheet state variables themselves.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Use 1000 to mean &quot;as many as possible&quot;.'><strong>desirable_ensemble_size</strong></td><td>1000</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Explain why this combination of data and experiments is important. How will it contribute to CMIP objectives?'><strong>expected_impacts</strong></td><td>The data requested from the Historical and Scenario simulations will primarily be used to create boundary conditions for a large ensemble of standalone Ice Sheet Model (ISMs) simulations under the auspices of ISMIP7, although some ESMs in CMIP7 may conduct these simulations with ice sheet components coupled in as well.  This combination output from ESM and ISM simulations will allow the future contribution of the icesheets to sea level rise to be projected and the model and scenario uncertainty of those projections to be characterised. In addition to ISMIP7, other MIPs concerned with ice sheet behaviour, primarily TIPMIP and MISOMIP may use these variables. Quantifying future sea level rise contributes to CMIP and WCRP efforts on the Long-term response of the climate system, safe landing climates and tipping points.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Explain how the data products requested map onto the expected outcomes. Include reference to the level of resources that will be needed to support this request and why they are proportionate to the expected impact.'><strong>justification_of_resources</strong></td><td>Atmosphere and land domain variables requested are primarily surface fields at frequencies from subdaily to monthly. A few full-depth ocean state variables are requested at monthly frequency. These will be assessed to inform potential subselection of the most appropriate climate models to use to generate mass balance boundary conditions for a large ensemble of downstream ice sheet model simulations. Earth System models that contain ice sheets are also requested to provide ice sheet state variables to characterise the ice sheet behaviour and impact on sea level.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Lead theme will coordinate communication and actions for the Opportunity'><strong>lead_theme</strong></td><td><span><a href="527f5c91-8c97-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654.html">Land &amp; Land-Ice</a></span></td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Default ensemble size, excluding multiple start times.

Tier 2 = High with overshoot, Medium-low, and Medium experiments [scen7-hc-ext-os/esm-scen7-hc-ext-os, scen7-mlc-ext/esm-scen7-mlc-ext, and scen7-mc-ext/esm-scen7-mc-ext].
We also request for groups to do longer than the minimum (2150) years for the scenario extensions, ideally a minimum date of 2400 for H-ext-OS and 2300 for the others to enable our Opportunity.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>dafc73b8-8c95-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654</td></tr></table><h2>Data Request Information</h2><table><tr><td class='field_name' title='To coordinate the process and review proposals five thematic author groups have been formed in five different topic areas: Atmosphere, Earth system, Impacts and adaptation, Land and land-ice, Ocean and sea-ice'><strong>data_request_themes</strong></td><td><span><span><a href="527f5c91-8c97-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654.html">Land &amp; Land-Ice</a></span></span></td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='These are non-exclusive grouping of experiments (e.g. ‘AR7 Fast Track’, ‘DECK’, ‘Scenarios’ etc.) required for this opportunity.
