The list of individual species that are included in a quantity having a group chemical standard name can vary between models. Where possible, the data variable should be accompanied by a complete description of the species represented, for example, by using a comment attribute. &quot;C&quot; means the element carbon and &quot;13C&quot; is the stable isotope &quot;carbon-13&quot;, having six protons and seven neutrons.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>mole_concentration_of_dissolved_inorganic_13C_in_sea_water</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>3ba74e69-8ca2-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>physical_parameters:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="59175660-9e49-11e5-803c-0d0b866b59f3.html">dissi13c (Dissolved Inorganic Carbon-13 Concentration)</a></li><li><a href="c96c720e-c5f0-11e6-ac20-5404a60d96b5.html">dissi13cos (Surface Dissolved Inorganic Carbon-13 Concentration)</a></li></ul></details><br><p><a href='../cf_standard_names.html'>Back to cf_standard_names</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
