We are interested in conducting atmospheric and oceanic dynamical downscaling of GCMs for Mexico. With outputs from the downscaling exercise a variety of research questions and impact assessment can be tackled. For instance:
\-      In the ocean, we could anticipate marine species’ range shifts through the evaluation of changes in circulation and bio-dispersal as well as changes in temperature and consequent optimal habitat re-distribution. With respect to temperature, recent marine heatwaves (MHWs) have caused the death of foundation species, habitat loss, and community reconfiguration. Thus, evaluating MHWs’ future occurrence, as well as that of upwelling, a mechanism that regulates their depth extent and duration, is of primary importance. This is of particular interest for kelp forests in Baja California and corals in the Caribbean Sea; two oceanic regions with highly valued ecosystem services and for which we envision performing downscaling.  
\-      In the atmosphere, it would allow solving the dynamics of the North American Monsoon (NAM) along the Mexican occidental mountain range, and consequently, a proper evaluation of changes in regional convective precipitation. This is crucial for adequate planning of irrigation infrastructure, and to assess the sustainability of crops that depend on seasonal rainfall. Similarly, atmospheric downscaling of GCMs is necessary to understand the response of the Caribbean Low-Level Jet (CLLJ) to warming climate and associated changes in frequency and intensity of extreme weather events as heatwaves and droughts in the Mesoamerican region.
 
Often, due to the lack of some global climate model outputs stored at high frequency (e.g., 3-hourly for atmospheric variables or daily ocean current velocities), the high frequency signal used in downscaling exercises does not come from the global climate models but from historic reanalyses or synthetic data. We believe a great improvement would be achieved by forcing downscaling with GCM high frequency output rather than historic or synthetic data. Particularly,
\-      In the oceanic realm, the high frequency signal (daily) is particularly important to identify and study extreme temperature events (i.e., MHWs, MCSs), upwelling, and biodispersal; all processes that we are particularly interested in reproducing when downscaling and that ideally, should be inherited from the simulated historic and climate scenarios.
\-      Comparably, realistic atmospheric simulations on climate time scales require a coupled land surface model (LSM) to implicitly solve the heat and mass exchanges between the atmosphere and the land surface, including those involving vegetation, which are central to the hydrological cycle. The use of LSMs in regional climate simulations, in turn, requires high frequency (6hr) 3D fields of soil temperature and moisture at specified soil depths, which ideally should be sourced from the same global climate simulations used to force the atmospheric model.
Thus, this opportunity proposes the storage of variables used for dynamical downscaling at high frequency; specifically:

We envisage proposing a variable group baseline daily ocean conformed by the necessary variables to force an oceanic model for dynamical downscaling at a daily temporal resolution.

We are interested in performing downscaling for historic and climate scenarios. The historic runs will complement observations to explore mechanisms behind identified historic long-term trends, and extreme events. Additionally, the historic run and downscaled product is the baseline to evaluate change in future climate scenarios.
