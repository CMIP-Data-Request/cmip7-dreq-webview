A chemical species or biological group denoted by X may be described by a single term such as &quot;nitrogen&quot; or a phrase such as &quot;nox_expressed_as_nitrogen&quot;. The phrase &quot;tendency_of_X&quot; means derivative of X with respect to time. The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. &quot;Chemical production&quot; means the result of all chemical reactions within the medium (here, atmosphere) that produce a certain amount of the particular species. The chemical formula for molecular hydrogen is H2.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>tendency_of_atmosphere_mole_concentration_of_molecular_hydrogen_due_to_chemical_production</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>80ab728f-a698-11ef-914a-613c0433d878</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>physical_parameters:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="f86eb69f-8ca1-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654.html">h2prod (chemical production of atmospheric H2)</a></li></ul></details><br><p><a href='../cf_standard_names.html'>Back to cf_standard_names</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
