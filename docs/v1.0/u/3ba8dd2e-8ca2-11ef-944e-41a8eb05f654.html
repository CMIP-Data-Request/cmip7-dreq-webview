This quantity additionally includes melt water from sea ice and icebergs. It is calculated relative to the heat that would be transported by runoff water entering the sea at zero degrees Celsius. It is calculated as the product QrunoffCpTrunoff, where Q runoff is the mass flux of liquid runoff entering the sea water (kg m-2 s-1), Cp is the specific heat capacity of water, and Trunoff is the temperature in degrees Celsius of the runoff water. In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, &quot;flux&quot; implies per unit area, called &quot;flux density&quot; in physics. The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. Runoff is the liquid water which drains from land. If not specified, &quot;runoff&quot; refers to the sum of surface runoff and subsurface drainage.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>temperature_flux_due_to_runoff_expressed_as_heat_flux_into_sea_water</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>3ba8dd2e-8ca2-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>physical_parameters:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="155ede0bff2578a736e6379552483f4e.html">hfrunoffds (Temperature Flux Due to Runoff Expressed as Heat Flux into Sea Water)</a></li></ul></details><br><br><p><a href='../cf_standard_names.html'>Back to cf_standard_names</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
