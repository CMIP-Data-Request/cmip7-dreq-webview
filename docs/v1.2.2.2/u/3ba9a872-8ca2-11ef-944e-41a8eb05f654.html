On land, &quot;nitrogen fixation&quot; means the uptake of nitrogen gas directly from the atmosphere. The representation of fixed nitrogen is model dependent, with the nitrogen entering either vegetation, soil or both. &quot;Vegetation&quot; means any living plants e.g. trees, shrubs, grass. The phrase &quot;expressed_as&quot; is used in the construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A. &quot;Nitrogen compounds&quot; summarizes all chemical species containing nitrogen atoms. The list of individual species that are included in this quantity can vary between models. Where possible, the data variable should be accompanied by a complete description of the species represented, for example, by using a comment attribute. The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>tendency_of_soil_and_vegetation_mass_content_of_nitrogen_compounds_expressed_as_nitrogen_due_to_fixation</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>3ba9a872-8ca2-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>physical_parameters:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="590d2ed8-9e49-11e5-803c-0d0b866b59f3.html">fBNF (Biological Nitrogen Fixation)</a></li></ul></details><br><p><a href='../cf_standard_names.html'>Back to cf_standard_names</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
