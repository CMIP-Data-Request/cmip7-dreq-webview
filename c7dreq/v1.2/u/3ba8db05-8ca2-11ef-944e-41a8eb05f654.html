A downward stress is a downward flux of momentum. Over large bodies of water, wind stress can drive near-surface currents. &quot;Downward&quot; indicates a vector component which is positive when directed downward (negative upward). &quot;Northward&quot; indicates a vector component which is positive when directed northward (negative southward). &quot;Downward northward&quot; indicates the ZY component of a tensor. A downward northward stress is a downward flux of northward momentum, which accelerates the lower medium northward and the upper medium southward.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>surface_downward_northward_stress</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>3ba8db05-8ca2-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>physical_parameters:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="bd10cebbde1593b65e5220911f9a997c.html">tauv (Surface Downward Northward Wind Stress)</a></li></ul></details><br><p><a href='../cf_standard_names.html'>Back to cf_standard_names</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
