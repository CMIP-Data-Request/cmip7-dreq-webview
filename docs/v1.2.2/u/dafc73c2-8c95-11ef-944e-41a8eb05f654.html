In the future, land-use activities are likely to expand and intensify further to meet growing demands for food, fiber, and energy. The Land Use Model Intercomparison Project (LUMIP) aims to further advance understanding of the impacts of land-use and land-cover change (LULCC) on climate, specifically addressing the following questions. (1) What are the effects of LULCC on climate and biogeochemical cycling (past–future)? (2) What are the impacts of land management on surface fluxes of carbon, water, and energy, and are there regional land-management strategies with the promise to help mitigate climate change?  These questions are particularly relevant in investigations of low emission scenarios, which typically rely on significant land-based mitigation to achieve climate targets.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Use 1000 to mean &quot;as many as possible&quot;.'><strong>desirable_ensemble_size</strong></td><td>1000</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Explain why this combination of data and experiments is important.

These variables are requested for historical and scenario simulations and for any specific Land Use Model Intercomparison Project (LUMIP) simulations.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Explain how the data products requested map onto the expected outcomes. Include reference to the level of resources that will be needed to support this request and why they are proportionate to the expected impact.'><strong>justification_of_resources</strong></td><td>This proposal and associated variables is critical for useful assessment of land use change in historical and scenario simulations.  This assessment is critical, especially to understand the considerable diversity of land model responses to imposed land use change and the diversity of imposed land use change itself.  It is also critical to aid in understanding of the strong diversity of land model representation of the terrestrial carbon sink and the potential for land-based mitigation.  The data request is modest in terms of size.

In that paper, the benefits of subgrid information on Land Use Tiles is described in more detail. For CMIP7, the number of land use tiles has expanded from 4 to 5, by splitting the Primary and Secondary Land tile in a Primary Land Tile and a Secondary Land Tile, in addition to those that are retained (Cropland, Pastureland, and Urban)</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Lead theme will coordinate communication and actions for the Opportunity'><strong>lead_theme</strong></td><td><span><a href="527f5c91-8c97-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654.html">Land &amp; Land-Ice</a></span></td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Default ensemble size, excluding multiple start times.
