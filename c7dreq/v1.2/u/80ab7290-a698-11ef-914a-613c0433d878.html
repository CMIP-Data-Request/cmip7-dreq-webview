The term &quot;longwave&quot; means longwave radiation. The abbreviation &quot;toa&quot; means top of atmosphere. The TOA outgoing longwave flux is the upwelling thermal radiative flux, often called the &quot;outgoing longwave radiation&quot; or &quot;OLR&quot;. In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, &quot;flux&quot; implies per unit area, called &quot;flux density&quot; in physics. &quot;Clear sky&quot; means in the absence of clouds. This 3D ozone field acts as a reference ozone field in a diagnostic call to the model&#x27;s radiation scheme. It is expressed in terms of mole fraction of ozone in air. It may be observation-based or model-derived. It may be from any time period. By using the same ozone reference in the diagnostic radiation call in two model simulations and calculating differences between the radiative flux diagnostics from the prognostic call to the radiation scheme and the diagnostic call to the radiation scheme with the ozone reference, an instantaneous radiative forcing for ozone can be calculated.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>toa_outgoing_longwave_flux_assuming_clear_sky_and_reference_mole_fraction_of_ozone_in_air</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>80ab7290-a698-11ef-914a-613c0433d878</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>physical_parameters:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="f86eb6bb-8ca1-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654.html">rlutcso3ref (Top of atmosphere outgoing longwave radiative flux under clear-sky conditions from diagnostic call to radiation scheme with a reference ozone field)</a></li></ul></details><br><p><a href='../cf_standard_names.html'>Back to cf_standard_names</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
