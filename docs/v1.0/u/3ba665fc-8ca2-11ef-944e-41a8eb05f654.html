The radiative flux is reduced by a factor exp(-optical_thickness) on traversing the path. The atmosphere optical thickness applies to radiation passing through the entire atmosphere. A coordinate variable of radiation_wavelength or radiation_frequency can be specified to indicate that the optical thickness applies at specific wavelengths or frequencies. &quot;Aerosol&quot; means the system of suspended liquid or solid particles in air (except cloud droplets) and their carrier gas, the air itself. &quot;Ambient aerosol particles&quot; are aerosol particles that have taken up ambient water through hygroscopic growth. The extent of hygroscopic growth depends on the relative humidity and the composition of the particles. &quot;Pm1 aerosol&quot; means atmospheric particulate compounds with an aerodynamic diameter of less than or equal to 1 micrometer. The specification of a physical process by the phrase due_to_process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>atmosphere_optical_thickness_due_to_pm1_ambient_aerosol_particles</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>3ba665fc-8ca2-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>physical_parameters:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="05aec7fe79d030ffc90a089a6a60b0f2.html">od550lt1aer (Ambient Fine Aerosol Optical Depth at 550nm)</a></li></ul></details><br><p><a href='../cf_standard_names.html'>Back to cf_standard_names</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
