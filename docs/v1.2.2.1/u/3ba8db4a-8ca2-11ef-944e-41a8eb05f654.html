The phrase &#x27;expressed_as&#x27; is used in the construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A. &quot;All land processes&quot; means plant and soil respiration, photosynthesis, animal grazing, crop harvesting, natural fires and anthropogenic land use change. &quot;Anthropogenic land use change&quot; means human changes to land, excluding forest regrowth. It includes fires ignited by humans for the purpose of land use change and the processes of eventual disposal and decomposition of wood products such as paper, cardboard, furniture and timber for construction. The quantity with standard name surface_net_downward_mass_flux_of_carbon_dioxide_expressed_as_carbon_due_to_all_land_processes is  equal to the difference  between the quantities with standard names surface_net_downward_mass_flux_of_carbon_dioxide_expressed_as_carbon_due_to_all_land_processes_excluding_anthropogenic_land_use_change and surface_net_upward_mass_flux_of_carbon_dioxide_expressed_as_carbon_due_to_emission_from_anthropogenic_land_use_change. In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, &quot;flux&quot; implies per unit area, called &quot;flux density&quot; in physics.  The specification of a physical process by the phrase due_to_process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase.  The chemical formula for carbon dioxide is CO2.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>surface_net_downward_mass_flux_of_carbon_dioxide_expressed_as_carbon_due_to_all_land_processes</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>3ba8db4a-8ca2-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>physical_parameters:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="337d362541c3e2a3f907abcaffa5c262.html">nbp (Carbon Mass Flux out of Atmosphere Due to Net Biospheric Production on Land [kgC m-2 s-1])</a></li><li><a href="590ed0a8-9e49-11e5-803c-0d0b866b59f3.html">nbpLut (Net Carbon Mass Flux into Land-Use Tile [kgC m-2 s-1])</a></li></ul></details><br><br><p><a href='../cf_standard_names.html'>Back to cf_standard_names</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
