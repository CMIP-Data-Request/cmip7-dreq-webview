CORDEX model output is an authoritative source of downscaled data due to the controlled and coordinated experimental setup. CORDEX dynamical downscaling activity (and other RCMs) require high-frequency lateral boundary conditions from GCMs for the historical and scenario periods.
This CORDEX request is similar to CMIP6, but with a temporal extension in the past to cover the GWL+0 and in the future, as 2100 is too soon now. Extension to 1850 is more important than extension to 2150. If the full period data are too much to store, the period 1901-1949 could be skipped (i.e. 1850-1900 for GWL+0 reference, and 1950-2150 for historical+scenario).
We are requesting 6hr data for the standard CORDEX resolution of about 12 km, but higher frequency (3hr?) could be needed for direct nesting of km-scale simulations, likely to be performed by the time of CORDEX-CMIP7. This would apply for GCM simulations with a grid spacing below ~40km (HighResMIP?).
To support this opportunity, it is not necessary to provide ALL the requested variable groups.  Rather, please select the variable groups for the subtopics you wish to support (soil, ocean, ocean biogeochemistry, air-sea, air-sea biogeochemistry, aerosols-chemistry).

How will it contribute to CMIP objectives?'><strong>expected_impacts</strong></td><td>The 3D data requested from the historical and scenario experiments are essential to perform dynamical downscaling. In the ongoing CORDEX-CMIP6 initiative, worldwide, more than 600 simulations are planned (250+ finished; <a href="https://wcrp-cordex.github.io/simulation-status/CMIP6_downscaling_plans.html" target="_blank">https://wcrp-cordex.github.io/simulation-status/CMIP6_downscaling_plans.html</a>) drawing from similar boundary forcings. These simulations are highly requested by downstream climate services.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Explain how the data products requested map onto the expected outcomes. Include reference to the level of resources that will be needed to support this request and why they are proportionate to the expected impact.'><strong>justification_of_resources</strong></td><td>Downscaling is a key step in filling the gap between CMIP7 global climate model experiments and the activity of the communities dealing with vulnerability, impacts and adaptation studies.
Dynamical downscaling requires 6-hourly 3D-global forcing fields for specific variables.
