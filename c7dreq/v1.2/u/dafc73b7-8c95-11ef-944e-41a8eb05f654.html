- Direct use of these variables and the derived ones for urban climate-driven risks assessment
- These variables will have very consequential implications for policy-making and climate actions, such as urban planning, sustainable development, and urban climate adaptation.
- Societal benefits and well-being, such as public health, climate extreme preparedness and resilience, etc.

A vast amount of literature supports the need for this data request and describes case studies. Some examples are listed below:

Include reference to the level of resources that will be needed to support this request and why they are proportionate to the expected impact.'><strong>justification_of_resources</strong></td><td>Over half of the World’s population lives in urban areas and the United Nations expects this to increase to 68% by 2050.  This opportunity will provide crucial information to robustly underpin research focused on characterizing and projecting the impacts of climate variability and change on urban populations, settlements, and infrastructure. A forthcoming IPCC Special Report on Cities (<a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2024/08/IPCC-61_decisions-adopted-by-the-Panel.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2024/08/IPCC-61_decisions-adopted-by-the-Panel.pdf</a>) is also proof of the need of coordinated research on this space.

Effective urban planning and sustainable development under climate change relies on robust climate projections specific to built landscapes. This includes improving understanding of city-specific risks in the form of extremes, their attribution, slow-onset events,  and the compounding and cascading of risks in order to inform those working to reduce vulnerability and exposure across urban systems and sectors, including, but not limited to critical infrastructure, buildings, urban ecosystems and biodiversity, food and population health.

A more accurate representation of urban systems is now present in an increasing number of  GCMs and ESMs, which will enable inter-model comparisons and uncertainty characterization from urban climate projections unlike in previous CMIP rounds. 

The requested variables can support studies focused on understanding projected impacts to urban environments (both people and infrastructure). One manifestation of such impacts is the urban heat island, which requires detailed sub-daily variables to be modeled. Another strong impact of weather extremes on cities is given by surface flooding, which depends strongly on precipitation rates. Finally, some requested variable support studies into the urban boundary layer height and near-surface winds, which are needed to characterize urban micro-climates and understand the modulation of  the impacts of air pollution.

The enhanced  temporal resolution requested in the additional variable group will enable analyzes of onset and development of events.
