A chemical or biological species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as &quot;nitrogen&quot; or a phrase such as &quot;nox_expressed_as_nitrogen&quot;. The phrase &quot;expressed_as&quot; is used in the construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A. Chlorophylls are the green pigments found in most plants, algae and cyanobacteria; their presence is essential for photosynthesis to take place. There are several different forms of chlorophyll that occur naturally. All contain a chlorin ring (chemical formula C20H16N4) which gives the green pigment and a side chain whose structure varies. The naturally occurring forms of chlorophyll contain between 35 and 55 carbon atoms. Diatoms are single-celled phytoplankton with an external skeleton made of silica. Phytoplankton are algae that grow where there is sufficient light to support photosynthesis.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>mass_concentration_of_diatoms_expressed_as_chlorophyll_in_sea_water</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>3ba74cb9-8ca2-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>physical_parameters:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="c947141b54f1ab48dba4a84cec99c5d3.html">chldiat (Mass Concentration of Diatoms Expressed as Chlorophyll in Sea Water)</a></li><li><a href="c96e0c22-c5f0-11e6-ac20-5404a60d96b5.html">chldiatos (Surface Mass Concentration of Diatoms Expressed as Chlorophyll in Sea Water)</a></li></ul></details><br><br><p><a href='../cf_standard_names.html'>Back to cf_standard_names</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
