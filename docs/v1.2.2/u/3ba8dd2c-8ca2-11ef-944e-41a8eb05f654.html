(The conversion of solid alone into vapor is called &quot;sublimation&quot;.)  The quantity with standard name temperature_flux_due_to_evaporation_expressed_as_heat_flux_out_of_sea_water is the heat energy carried by the transfer of water away from the liquid ocean through the process of evaporation.  It is distinct from the transfer of latent heat and is calculated relative to the heat that would be transported by water evaporating at zero degrees Celsius. It is calculated as the product QevapCpTevap, where Qevap is the mass flux of evaporating water (kg m-2 s-1), Cp is the specific heat capacity of water and Tevap is the temperature in degrees Celsius of the evaporating water. In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, &quot;flux&quot; implies per unit area, called &quot;flux density&quot; in physics.  The specification of a physical process by the phrase due_to_process means that the quantity named is a  single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity  named by omitting the phrase.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>temperature_flux_due_to_evaporation_expressed_as_heat_flux_out_of_sea_water</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>3ba8dd2c-8ca2-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>physical_parameters:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="11f31866ee4fca2f68e25ccd529ede8a.html">hfevapds (Temperature Flux Due to Evaporation Expressed as Heat Flux out of Sea Water)</a></li></ul></details><br><br><p><a href='../cf_standard_names.html'>Back to cf_standard_names</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
