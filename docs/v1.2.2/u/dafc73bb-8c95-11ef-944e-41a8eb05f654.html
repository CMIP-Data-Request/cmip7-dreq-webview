The bulk of Earth&#x27;s water is in the ocean, and even small changes to this reservoir will have very, very large corresponding changes across other realms. Keeping track of the very large latent energy fluxes also ties together Earth&#x27;s energy and water cycles in a way that should be considered in concert</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Explain why this combination of data and experiments is important. How will it contribute to CMIP objectives?'><strong>expected_impacts</strong></td><td>In a closed system, the flow of water through realms should be traceable - linking terrestrial groundwater use to sea level rise for e.g. Similarly changes to ocean salinity reflect freshwater relocation either within the closed ocean system, or exported to another realm (generally through the atmospheric pathway). A holistic view of the water/energy cycles will require variables saved across realms, and doing this in a coherent way would aid their use in developing and understanding of water cycle changes, what are driving these and how comparable modelled historical changes are to our imperfect observational estimates</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Explain how the data products requested map onto the expected outcomes.
