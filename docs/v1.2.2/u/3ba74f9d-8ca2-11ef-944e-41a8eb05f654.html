Net primary production is the excess of gross primary production (rate of synthesis of biomass from inorganic precursors) by autotrophs (&quot;producers&quot;), for example, photosynthesis in plants or phytoplankton, over the rate at which the autotrophs themselves respire some of this biomass. &quot;Productivity&quot; means production per unit area. The phrase &quot;expressed_as&quot; is used in the construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A. The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. &quot;Nitrate utilization&quot; means net primary production by phytoplankton based on nitrate alone. Phytoplankton are algae that grow where there is sufficient light to support photosynthesis. The chemical formula for the nitrate anion is NO3-.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>net_primary_mole_productivity_of_biomass_expressed_as_carbon_due_to_nitrate_utilization</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>3ba74f9d-8ca2-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>physical_parameters:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="c971e98c-c5f0-11e6-ac20-5404a60d96b5.html">intppnitrate (Primary Organic Carbon Production by Phytoplankton Based on Nitrate Uptake Alone)</a></li></ul></details><br><p><a href='../cf_standard_names.html'>Back to cf_standard_names</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
