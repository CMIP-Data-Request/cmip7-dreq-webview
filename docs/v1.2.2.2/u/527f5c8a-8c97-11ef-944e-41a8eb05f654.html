The previous exercises motivate the move towards realistic configurations and more diverse model parameters and resolutions. The main objective of MISOMIP2 is to investigate the performance of existing ocean and coupled ocean--ice-sheet models in a range of Antarctic environments, through comparisons to interannual observational data. We will assess the status of ocean-ice sheet modelling as a community and identify common characteristics of models that are best able to capture observed features. As models are highly tuned based on present-day data, we will also compare their sensitivity to prescribed abrupt atmospheric perturbations leading to either very warm or slightly warmer ocean conditions compared to present-day. The approach of MISOMIP2 is to welcome contributions of models as they are, but we request standardised variables and common grids for the outputs. There will be two target regions, the Amundsen Sea and the Weddell Sea, chosen because they describe two extremely different ocean environments and have been relatively well observed compared to other parts of Antarctica. An observational `MIPkit&#x27; is provided to evaluate ocean and ice sheet models in these two regions.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='MIP Long Name'><strong>mip_long_name</strong></td><td>Marine Ice Sheet-Ocean Model Intercomparions Project</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='URL to MIP website'><strong>mip_website</strong></td><td><a href="https://misomip.github.io/" target="_blank">https://misomip.github.io/</a></td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='MIP short name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>MISOMIP2</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>527f5c8a-8c97-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>opportunities:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="dafc73b8-8c95-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654.html">Ice sheet mass loss, contributions to sea level rise and freshwater flux input to the climate system</a></li></ul></details><br><p><a href='../mips.html'>Back to mips</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
