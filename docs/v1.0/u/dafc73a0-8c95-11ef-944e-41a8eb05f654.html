Climate services and climate impact modelling are a vital step in the value chain for understanding and managing the risks of a changing climate.  The communities that undertake these activities depend on CMIP data outputs as inputs to onward &quot;impact&quot; models (e.g., for energy, water, agriculture, financial services, health).  These impact models can be highly complex with non-linear dependences on meteorological properties.  Many of these impact models themselves use only a handful of common surface/near-surface variables but require fine-resolution data in both time and space.  Hitherto, the availability of such input data from CMIP has been - at best - patchy.  This has inhibited impact modelling by requiring compromises on impact model resolution (e.g., use of daily or monthly rather than sub-daily ) and inter-model comparison (e.g., only a few CMIP models providing relevant output), or prevented the application of CMIP simulations in high-quality impact models completely.

The proposal is therefore for CMIP models running &#x27;real world&#x27; simulations to output a small set of surface/near-surface climate variables at sub-daily (preferably hourly) grid-point resolution to support the provision of climate impact modelling, climate services and climate adaptation across a wide range of topics, including but not limited to infrastructure, energy, finance, health, agriculture &amp; water.  It is therefore tressed that while this request is substantial, it is intended to support a wide range of activities and &quot;downstream&quot; impact communities.

Time slices apply to all experiments within this opportunity that output data within the following time slice periods:
hist20 and histext as priority 1 (high),
hist43 and histext as priority 2 (medium),
piControl050 and histext as priority 3 (low),
scenario20mid as priority 1 (high),
scenario30mid as priority 2 (medium),
scenario10mid as priority 3 (low) if 3 ensemble members possible,
scenario20 as priority 1 (high).
histext is included because the I&amp;A community would like historical time slices that are as close to the present as possible.

This is to underpin a very wide range of climate service activities in support of climate impact assessment and climate adaptation.  The onward modelling often requires higher frequency data than has previously been provided by CMIP creating a substantial barrier to climate service provision.

Note by David Brayshaw, posted by @Briony Turner 16 September 2024

I&amp;A author team have identified the following missing opportunities for I&amp;A -this is our most cover-all opportunity so parking this note here for now, can be shifted post sprint once actions assigned:
Sub-daily Extreme Analysis (CORDEX, Climate Services) - came from the mural board (climserv panel)
Dynamical Downscaling Opportunity (CORDEX) (from mural board)
Dynamical Downscaling including aerosols and chemistry (CORDEX)
Statistical Downscaling Opportunity (CORDEX) (from mural board)
RCM Emulator opportunity (from mural board)
Regional ocean climate-related forcing data (CLIVAR/CORDEX)
Underwater Cultural heritage (UCH) risk assessment 
Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project - Atmospheric forsings (ISIMIP)
3-hourly atmospheric forcings for ISIMIP

New “impact_climserv_core_expt” experiment list means removing the following experiments as they have less relevance to I&amp;A studies: 1pctCO2-bgc, 1pctCO2-rad, abrupt-0p5CO2, abrupt-127k, abrupt-2xCO2, amip-p4k, amip-piForcing, esm-flat10-cdr, esm-flat10-zec, SSPX-SLCF, hist-piAer, hist-piSLCF, piClim-aer, piClim-histaer, piClim-histall, piClim-X.

All experiments listed in “impact_climserv_core_expt” requested to provide data throughout entire simulation.  Historic experiments (hist* and esm-hist) can use hist72 timeslice.  Future scenarios can prioritize period to 2100, with extension beyond this considered much a lower priority.  Note that there are comments on the airtable opportunity regarding timeslices “updated time slices for historical experiment” and “scenario time slices” but I cannot read these to check them.  Please check and confirm that they match the stated intentions here.

The I&amp;A community (these opportunities and others) is interested in time slices that are as close to present as possible. That means updating hist20 to be 2005-2024 (or equivalent) rather than 1995-2014, and hist36 would become hist46 to capture the satellite era (1979-2024). Hist20 and Hist30 would be similar to branch20 and the matching branch30. Let&#x27;s also introduce hist30 for those who can do 1995-2024</td></tr></table><h2>Data Request Information</h2><table><tr><td class='field_name' title='To coordinate the process and review proposals five thematic author groups have been formed in five different topic areas: Atmosphere, Earth system, Impacts and adaptation, Land and land-ice, Ocean and sea-ice'><strong>data_request_themes</strong></td><td><span><span><a href="527f5c8f-8c97-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654.html">Impacts &amp; Adaptation</a></span>, <span><a href="527f5c90-8c97-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654.html">Atmosphere</a></span>, <span><a href="527f5c91-8c97-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654.html">Land &amp; Land-Ice</a></span>, <span><a href="527f5c92-8c97-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654.html">Ocean &amp; Sea-Ice</a></span></span></td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='These are non-exclusive grouping of experiments (e.g. ‘AR7 Fast Track’, ‘DECK’, ‘Scenarios’ etc.) required for this opportunity.
