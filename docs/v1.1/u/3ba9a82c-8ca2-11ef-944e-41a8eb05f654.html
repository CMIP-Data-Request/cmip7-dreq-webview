The list of individual species that are included in a quantity having a group chemical standard name can vary between models. Where possible, the data variable should be accompanied by a complete description of the species represented, for example, by using a comment attribute. The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. Runoff is the liquid water which drains from land. If not specified, &quot;runoff&quot; refers to the sum of surface runoff and subsurface drainage.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>tendency_of_ocean_mole_content_of_inorganic_carbon_due_to_runoff_and_sediment_dissolution</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>3ba9a82c-8ca2-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>physical_parameters:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="9c4f9fe04addd510e5fbedd35e01a5db.html">icfriver (Flux of Inorganic Carbon into Ocean Surface by Runoff)</a></li></ul></details><br><p><a href='../cf_standard_names.html'>Back to cf_standard_names</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
