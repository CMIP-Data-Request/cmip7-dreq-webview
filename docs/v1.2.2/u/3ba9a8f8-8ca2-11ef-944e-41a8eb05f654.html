An upward eastward momentum flux is an upward flux of eastward momentum, which accelerates the upper medium eastward and the lower medium westward.  Momentum flux is dimensionally equivalent to stress and pressure.  In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, &quot;flux&quot; implies per unit area, called &quot;flux density&quot; in physics. The total upward eastward momentum flux due to gravity waves is the sum of the fluxes due to orographic gravity waves and nonorographic waves. The upward eastward momentum flux due to orographic gravity waves has the standard name upward_eastward_momentum_flux_in_air_due_to_orographic_gravity_waves. The total upward eastward momentum flux due to nonorographic gravity waves is the sum of the fluxes due to eastward and westward propagating waves. The latter has the standard name upward_eastward_momentum_flux_in_air_due_to_nonorographic_westward_gravity_waves.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>upward_eastward_momentum_flux_in_air_due_to_nonorographic_eastward_gravity_waves</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>3ba9a8f8-8ca2-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>physical_parameters:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="f86eb6dc-8ca1-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654.html">tauunoegw (Eastward Reynolds stress from non-orographic eastward gravity wave parameterization)</a></li></ul></details><br><p><a href='../cf_standard_names.html'>Back to cf_standard_names</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
