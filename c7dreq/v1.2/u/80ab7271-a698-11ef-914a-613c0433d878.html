The term &quot;longwave&quot; means longwave radiation. Upwelling radiation is radiation from below. It does not mean &quot;net upward&quot;. The sign convention is that &quot;upwelling&quot; is positive upwards and &quot;downwelling&quot; is positive downwards. When thought of as being incident on a surface, a radiative flux is sometimes called &quot;irradiance&quot;. In addition, it is identical with the quantity measured by a cosine-collector light-meter and sometimes called &quot;vector irradiance&quot;. In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, &quot;flux&quot; implies per unit area, called &quot;flux density&quot; in physics. A phrase assuming_condition indicates that the named quantity is the value which would obtain if all aspects of the system were unaltered except for the assumption of the circumstances specified by the condition. &quot;Clear sky&quot; means in the absence of clouds.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>surface_upwelling_longwave_flux_in_air_assuming_clear_sky_and_no_aerosol</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>80ab7271-a698-11ef-914a-613c0433d878</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>physical_parameters:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="80ab71dc-a698-11ef-914a-613c0433d878.html">rluscsaf (Surface Upwelling Clean Clear-Sky Longwave Radiation)</a></li></ul></details><br><p><a href='../cf_standard_names.html'>Back to cf_standard_names</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
