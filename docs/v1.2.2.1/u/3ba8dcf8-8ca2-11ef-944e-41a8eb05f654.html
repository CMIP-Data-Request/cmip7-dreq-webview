In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, &quot;flux&quot; implies per unit area, called &quot;flux density&quot; in physics. The chemical formula for carbon dioxide is CO2. The phrase &quot;expressed_as&quot; is used in the construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A. The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. Plant respiration is the sum of respiration by parts of plants both above and below the soil. It is assumed that all the respired carbon dioxide is emitted to the atmosphere. The term &quot;plants&quot; refers to the kingdom of plants in the modern classification which excludes fungi. Plants are autotrophs i.e. &quot;producers&quot; of biomass using carbon obtained from carbon dioxide.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>surface_upward_mass_flux_of_carbon_dioxide_expressed_as_carbon_due_to_plant_respiration</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>3ba8dcf8-8ca2-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>physical_parameters:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="2d38bda3114d03f7543b8af88aadd03a.html">ra (Carbon Mass Flux into Atmosphere Due to Autotrophic (Plant) Respiration on Land [kgC m-2 s-1])</a></li><li><a href="84f105a6-acb7-11e6-b5ee-ac72891c3257.html">raGrass (Autotrophic Respiration on Grass Tiles as Carbon Mass Flux [kgC m-2 s-1])</a></li><li><a href="59140726-9e49-11e5-803c-0d0b866b59f3.html">raLut (Autotrophic Respiration on Land-Use Tile as Carbon Mass Flux [kgC m-2 s-1])</a></li><li><a href="84f108a8-acb7-11e6-b5ee-ac72891c3257.html">raShrub (Autotrophic Respiration on Shrub Tiles as Carbon Mass Flux [kgC m-2 s-1])</a></li><li><a href="84f0b5e2-acb7-11e6-b5ee-ac72891c3257.html">raTree (Autotrophic Respiration on Tree Tiles as Carbon Mass Flux [kgC m-2 s-1])</a></li><li><a href="f86eb6b5-8ca1-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654.html">raVgt (Autotrophic Respiration on Vegetation type as Carbon Mass Flux [kgC m-2 s-1])</a></li></ul></details><br><br><p><a href='../cf_standard_names.html'>Back to cf_standard_names</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
