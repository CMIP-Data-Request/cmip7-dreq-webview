Scattering of radiation is its deflection from its incident path without loss of energy. The volume scattering function is the intensity (flux per unit solid angle) of scattered radiation per unit length of scattering medium, normalised by the incident radiation flux. The (range of) direction(s) of scattering can be specified by a coordinate of scattering_angle.  A coordinate variable of radiation_wavelength or radiation_frequency can be specified to indicate that the scattering applies at specific wavelengths or frequencies. The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. &quot;Aerosol&quot; means the system of suspended liquid or solid particles in air (except cloud droplets) and their carrier gas, the air itself. &quot;Ambient_aerosol&quot; means that the aerosol is measured or modelled at the ambient state of pressure, temperature and relative humidity that exists in its immediate environment. &quot;Ambient aerosol particles&quot; are aerosol particles that have taken up ambient water through hygroscopic growth. The extent of hygroscopic growth depends on the relative humidity and the composition of the particles. To specify the relative humidity and temperature at which the quantity described by the standard name applies, provide scalar coordinate variables with standard names of &quot;relative_humidity&quot; and &quot;air_temperature&quot;.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>volume_scattering_function_of_radiative_flux_in_air_due_to_ambient_aerosol_particles</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>3ba9a9aa-8ca2-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>physical_parameters:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="c9a77f2a-c5f0-11e6-ac20-5404a60d96b5.html">bs550aer (Aerosol Backscatter Coefficient)</a></li></ul></details><br><p><a href='../cf_standard_names.html'>Back to cf_standard_names</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
