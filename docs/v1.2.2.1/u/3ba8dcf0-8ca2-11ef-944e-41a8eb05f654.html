In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, &quot;flux&quot; implies per unit area, called &quot;flux density&quot; in physics. The phrase &quot;expressed_as&quot; is used in the construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A. The chemical formula for carbon dioxide is CO2. The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. &quot;Emission&quot; means emission from a primary source located anywhere within the atmosphere, including at the lower boundary (i.e. the surface of the earth). &quot;Emission&quot; is a process entirely distinct from &quot;re-emission&quot; which is used in some standard names. The term &quot;fires&quot; means all biomass fires, whether naturally occurring or ignited by humans. The quantity with standard name surface_upward_mass_flux_of_carbon_dioxide_expressed_as_carbon_due_to_emission_from_fires is the sum of the quantities with standard names surface_upward_mass_flux_of_carbon_dioxide_expressed_as_carbon_due_to_emission_from_vegetation_in_fires and surface_upward_mass_flux_of_carbon_dioxide_expressed_as_carbon_due_to_emission_from_litter_in_fires.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>surface_upward_mass_flux_of_carbon_dioxide_expressed_as_carbon_due_to_emission_from_fires</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>3ba8dcf0-8ca2-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>physical_parameters:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="590eb456-9e49-11e5-803c-0d0b866b59f3.html">fFireAll (Carbon Mass Flux into Atmosphere Due to CO2 Emission from Fire Including All Sources [kgC m-2 s-1])</a></li></ul></details><br><br><p><a href='../cf_standard_names.html'>Back to cf_standard_names</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
