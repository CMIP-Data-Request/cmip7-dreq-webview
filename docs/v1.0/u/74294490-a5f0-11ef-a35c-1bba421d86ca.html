The phrase &quot;expressed_as&quot; is used in the construction &quot;A_expressed_as_B&quot;, where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A. The &quot;sea_ice content&quot; of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface down to the bottom of the sea ice. &quot;Sea ice&quot; means all ice floating in the sea which has formed from freezing sea water, rather than by other processes such as calving of land ice to form icebergs. Sea-ice algae (or simply &#x27;ice algae&#x27; when the context of sea ice is clear) refer to algae uniquely able to thrive within the sea-ice environment. This distinction from phytoplankton is essential, as several phytoplankton species that become trapped in sea ice eventually perish due to a lack of genetic adaptation or acclimation strategies to survive such conditions. By referring to &#x27;sea-ice algae, &#x27; we highlight these algae&#x27;s specific features and ecological significance within the sea-ice habitat.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>sea_ice_mole_content_of_ice_algae_expressed_as_carbon</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>74294490-a5f0-11ef-a35c-1bba421d86ca</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>physical_parameters:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="f86eb6cb-8ca1-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654.html">sialgc (Total Ice Algal Carbon Amount)</a></li></ul></details><br><br><p><a href='../cf_standard_names.html'>Back to cf_standard_names</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
