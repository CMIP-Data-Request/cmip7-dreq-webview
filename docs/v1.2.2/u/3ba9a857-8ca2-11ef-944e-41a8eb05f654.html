The phrase &quot;expressed_as_heat_content&quot; means that this quantity is calculated as the specific heat capacity times density of sea water multiplied by the conservative temperature of the sea water in the grid cell and integrated over depth. If used for a layer heat content, coordinate bounds should be used to define the extent of the layers. If no coordinate bounds are specified, it is assumed that the integral is calculated over the entire vertical extent of the medium, e.g, if the medium is sea water the integral is assumed to be calculated over the full depth of the ocean. Conservative Temperature is defined as part of the Thermodynamic Equation of Seawater 2010 (TEOS-10) which was adopted in 2010 by the International Oceanographic Commission (IOC). Conservative Temperature is specific potential enthalpy (which has the standard name sea_water_specific_potential_enthalpy) divided by a fixed value of the specific heat capacity of sea water, namely cp_0 = 3991.86795711963 J kg-1 K-1. Conservative Temperature is a more accurate measure of the &quot;heat content&quot; of sea water, by a factor of one hundred, than is potential temperature. Because of this, it can be regarded as being proportional to the heat content of sea water per unit mass.

The specification of a physical process by the phrase due_to_process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. Parameterized eddy advection in an ocean model means the part due to a scheme representing parameterized eddy-induced advective effects not included in the resolved model velocity field. Parameterized submesoscale eddy advection occurs on a spatial scale of the order of 1 km horizontally. Reference: James C. McWilliams 2016, Submesoscale currents in the ocean, Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences, volume 472, issue 2189. DOI: 10.1098/rspa.2016.0117. There are also standard names for parameterized_mesoscale_eddy_advection which, along with parameterized_submesoscale_eddy_advection, contributes to the total parameterized eddy advection. Additionally, when the parameterized advective process is represented in the model as a skew-diffusion rather than an advection, then the parameterized skew diffusion should be included in this diagnostic. The convergence of a skew-flux is identical (in the continuous formulation) to the convergence of an advective flux, making their tendencies the same.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>tendency_of_sea_water_conservative_temperature_expressed_as_heat_content_due_to_parameterized_submesoscale_eddy_advection</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>3ba9a857-8ca2-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>physical_parameters:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="1742f769c80d35356bf80ab91789eec6.html">ocontemppsmadvect (Tendency of Sea Water Conservative Temperature Expressed as Heat Content Due to Parameterized Submesoscale Advection)</a></li></ul></details><br><br><p><a href='../cf_standard_names.html'>Back to cf_standard_names</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
