Furthermore, by leveraging the large datasets including DCPP hindcasts, comprehensive risk assessments can be performed for climate related extremes, including high impact weather events such as windstorms and precipitation, flooding, drought, marine heat waves.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Explain why this combination of data and experiments is important. How will it contribute to CMIP objectives?'><strong>expected_impacts</strong></td><td>Climate predictions are used to study climate variability and climate change relevant to decision-making from a few seasons to ten years ahead. The enhanced list of variables compared to previous CMIP phases of decadal prediction experiments will allow the study of new aspects of climate predictability, including climate extremes and carbon cycle. The availability of high temporal frequency data will lead to improved physical understanding of processes shaping extremes and high-impact events and improved understanding of the differences between models and how they represent risks.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Explain how the data products requested map onto the expected outcomes. Include reference to the level of resources that will be needed to support this request and why they are proportionate to the expected impact.'><strong>justification_of_resources</strong></td><td>The demand for climate information, especially about future changes and the potential for climate extremes, has grown in demand for numerous sectors including energy, agriculture, water and ecosystem management, and human health. Therefore, reliable climate predictions are essential for long-term planning, for climate risk assessments and climate adaptation strategies. Furthermore, extreme events, such as high-impact weather events, or marine heat waves, can have large impacts on human health, society and ecosystems, but are, by definition, rare events and require large datasets to properly quantify and understand. CMIP experiments, and especially those related to DCPP, have potential to help fulfill this demand, and to underpin the development of robust climate services. To do so successfully requires the production of high temporal frequency data across the globe in a range of variables and across a range of domains, including atmospheric, oceanic, ice, and biogeochemical processes.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Lead theme will coordinate communication and actions for the Opportunity'><strong>lead_theme</strong></td><td><span><a href="527f5c93-8c97-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654.html">Earth System</a></span></td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Default ensemble size, excluding multiple start times.
