While conventional analysis approaches (using monthly mean model outputs) have provided evidence that evolution and characteristics of the sea ice pack are central to Polar Amplification, there still remains uncertainty of the causal mechanisms and pathways through which Polar Amplification occur. For example, we cannot clearly state which processes (clouds, atmospheric heat transport, ocean heat transport, sea ice albedo feedback, etc.) are most important is causing the sea ice loss and thus Polar Amplification. Evidence exists that the processes and feedbacks between the ice pack, the atmosphere, and the ocean that are central to Polar Amplification unfold at high frequency (e.g., days to weeks) and thus the contributions of high frequency variability (atmospheric rivers and cyclones) to the inter-model spread in Polar Amplification cannot be currently assessed. This opportunity provides the necessary model outputs to determine the contribution of high frequency processes to causing Polar Amplification and their contributions to inter-model spread.

Moreover, warming that occurs in the polar regions has an outsized effect (with respect to its area) on global sea level rise and changes in the global carbon cycle (via permafrost). Polar climate change also has global implications through modulations of the global thermohaline circulation. The rate of change in the Arctic has implications on the future needs for economic development in the Arctic, geopolitical ramifications (potential future conflict over Arctic natural resources), and adaptation needs. Modeling centers should allocate resources to the assessment of Polar Amplification because of is far reaching impacts on global society and wide spread scientific interest in the topic. </td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Lead theme will coordinate communication and actions for the Opportunity'><strong>lead_theme</strong></td><td><span><a href="527f5c92-8c97-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654.html">Ocean &amp; Sea-Ice</a></span></td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Default ensemble size, excluding multiple start times.
