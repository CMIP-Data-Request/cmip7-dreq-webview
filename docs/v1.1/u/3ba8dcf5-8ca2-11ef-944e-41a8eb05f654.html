The phrase &#x27;expressed_as&#x27; is used in the construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A. In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, &quot;flux&quot; implies per unit area, called &quot;flux density&quot; in physics.  The surface called &quot;surface&quot; means the lower boundary of the atmosphere.  The specification of a physical process by the phrase due_to_process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase.  &quot;Emission&quot; means emission from a primary source located anywhere within the atmosphere, including at the lower boundary (i.e. earth&#x27;s surface). &quot;Emission&quot; is a process entirely distinct from &quot;re-emission&quot; which is used in some standard names. The chemical formula for carbon dioxide is CO2.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>surface_upward_mass_flux_of_carbon_dioxide_expressed_as_carbon_due_to_emission_from_natural_sources</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>3ba8dcf5-8ca2-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>physical_parameters:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="299fb9d19040c4aa3862644286261ad2.html">fco2nat (Surface Carbon Mass Flux into the Atmosphere Due to Natural Sources [kgC m-2 s-1])</a></li></ul></details><br><br><p><a href='../cf_standard_names.html'>Back to cf_standard_names</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
