A chemical or biological species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as &quot;nitrogen&quot; or a phrase such as &quot;nox_expressed_as_nitrogen&quot;. The phrase &quot;tendency_of_X&quot; means derivative of X with respect to time. The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. &quot;Chemical production&quot; means the result of all chemical reactions within the medium (here, atmosphere) that produce a certain amount of the particular species. In chemistry, a &quot;radical&quot; is a highly reactive, and therefore short lived, species. The chemical formula for the hydroxyl radical is OH. The chemical formula for atomic_singlet_oxygen is O1D. The chemical formula for water vapor is H2O. Here, the production of hydroxyl radical is equal to 2k[O1D][H2O], i.e., 2 hydroxyl radicals are formed from the reaction of O1D with H2O. For models that do not have O1D as a species, the production of hydroxyl radical may be represented differently but the chemical production should take account of the hydroxyl yield.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>tendency_of_atmosphere_mole_concentration_of_hydroxyl_radical_due_to_chemical_production_from_atomic_singlet_oxygen_and_water_vapor</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>74294497-a5f0-11ef-a35c-1bba421d86ca</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>physical_parameters:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="f86eb667-8ca1-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654.html">chegph2oo1d (Chemical production of OH by reaction of O1D+H2O)</a></li></ul></details><br><br><p><a href='../cf_standard_names.html'>Back to cf_standard_names</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
