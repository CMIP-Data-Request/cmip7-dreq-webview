The proper representation of the plant's active season impacts the accuracy of the Earth system models in representing energy, carbon, and water exchanges between land and atmosphere.
For this reason, the availability of these variables at the vegetation type level can increase our understanding of model limitations (Li et al., 2024, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-23-0179.1" target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-23-0179.1</a>) and their expected future changes.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Explain why this combination of data and experiments is important. How will it contribute to CMIP objectives?'><strong>expected_impacts</strong></td><td>The historical experiment provides a benchmark to evaluate the model plant phenology biases (e.g. Peano et al., 2021, <a href="https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-2405-2021" target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-2405-2021</a>) while scenarios supply future changes. The main variable is the leaf area index (lai) commonly used to estimate the main phenophases (e.g. Peano et al., 2019, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2018JG004881" target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.1029/2018JG004881</a>). The variables of carbon exchange between land and atmosphere (i.e. gpp, npp, rh, and ra) allow us to link the biases in productivity with changes in phenology (e.g. Li et al., 2023, [10.22541/essoar.168298711.15374345/v1](<a href="https://doi.org/10.22541/essoar.168298711.15374345/v1" target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.22541/essoar.168298711.15374345/v1</a>)). Finally, the landCoverFrac variable provides the relative influence of each vegetation type on the total grid cell.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Explain how the data products requested map onto the expected outcomes.

This opportunity delineates a set of variables and experiments needed to expand our understanding of model weaknesses and strengths.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Lead theme will coordinate communication and actions for the Opportunity'><strong>lead_theme</strong></td><td><span><a href="527f5c91-8c97-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654.html">Land &amp; Land-Ice</a></span></td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Default ensemble size, excluding multiple start times.
