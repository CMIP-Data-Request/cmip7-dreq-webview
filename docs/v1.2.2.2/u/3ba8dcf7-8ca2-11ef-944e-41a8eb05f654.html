In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, &quot;flux&quot; implies per unit area, called &quot;flux density&quot; in physics. The chemical formula for carbon dioxide is CO2. The phrase &quot;expressed_as&quot; is used in the construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A. The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. Heterotrophic respiration is respiration by heterotrophs (&quot;consumers&quot;), which are organisms (including animals and decomposers) that consume other organisms or dead organic material, rather than synthesising organic material from inorganic precursors using energy from the environment (especially sunlight) as autotrophs (&quot;producers&quot;) do. Heterotrophic respiration goes on both above and within the soil.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>surface_upward_mass_flux_of_carbon_dioxide_expressed_as_carbon_due_to_heterotrophic_respiration</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>3ba8dcf7-8ca2-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>physical_parameters:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="93723bb54a2c43450d75403102e618ac.html">rh (Total Heterotrophic Respiration on Land as Carbon Mass Flux [kgC m-2 s-1])</a></li><li><a href="84f0beac-acb7-11e6-b5ee-ac72891c3257.html">rhGrass (Heterotrophic Respiration on Grass Tiles as Carbon Mass Flux [kgC m-2 s-1])</a></li><li><a href="5912a174-9e49-11e5-803c-0d0b866b59f3.html">rhLut (Heterotrophic Respiration on Land-Use Tile as Carbon Mass Flux [kgC m-2 s-1])</a></li><li><a href="84f0f354-acb7-11e6-b5ee-ac72891c3257.html">rhShrub (Heterotrophic Respiration on Shrub Tiles as Carbon Mass Flux [kgC m-2 s-1])</a></li><li><a href="84f1117c-acb7-11e6-b5ee-ac72891c3257.html">rhTree (Heterotrophic Respiration on Tree Tiles as Carbon Mass Flux [kgC m-2 s-1])</a></li><li><a href="f86eb6b7-8ca1-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654.html">rhVgt (Heterotrophic Respiration on Vegetation type as Carbon Mass Flux [kgC m-2 s-1])</a></li></ul></details><br><p><a href='../cf_standard_names.html'>Back to cf_standard_names</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
