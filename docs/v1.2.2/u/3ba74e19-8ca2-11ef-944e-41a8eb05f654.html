The phrase &quot;minus_tendency&quot; means that the quantity described takes the opposite sign convention to that for the quantity which has the same standard name apart from this phrase, i.e. the two quantities differ from one another by a factor of -1. Thus a &quot;minus_tendency&quot; in the atmosphere means a positive deposition rate onto the underlying surface. &quot;Content&quot; indicates a quantity per unit area. The &quot;atmosphere content&quot; of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the atmosphere. For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard names including &quot;content_of_atmosphere_layer&quot; are used. The phrase &quot;expressed_as&quot; is used in the construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A. &quot;Nitrogen compounds&quot; summarizes all chemical species containing nitrogen atoms. Usually, particle bound and gaseous nitrogen compounds, such as atomic nitrogen (N), nitrogen monoxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), dinitrogen pentoxide (N2O5), nitric acid (HNO3), nitrate (NO3-), peroxynitric acid (HNO4), ammonia (NH3), ammonium (NH4+), bromine nitrate (BrONO2), chlorine nitrate (ClONO2) and organic nitrates (most notably peroxyacetyl nitrate, sometimes referred to as PAN, (CH3COO2NO2)) are included. The list of individual species that are included in this quantity can vary between models. Where possible, the data variable should be accompanied by a complete description of the species represented, for example, by using a comment attribute. The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. &quot;Deposition&quot; is the sum of wet and dry deposition.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>minus_tendency_of_atmosphere_mass_content_of_nitrogen_compounds_expressed_as_nitrogen_due_to_deposition</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>3ba74e19-8ca2-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>physical_parameters:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="5913bfe6-9e49-11e5-803c-0d0b866b59f3.html">fNdep (Dry and Wet Deposition of Reactive Nitrogen onto Land)</a></li></ul></details><br><p><a href='../cf_standard_names.html'>Back to cf_standard_names</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
