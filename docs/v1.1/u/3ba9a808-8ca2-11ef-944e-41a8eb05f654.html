Mole concentration means number of moles per unit volume, also called &quot;molarity&quot;, and is used in the construction mole_concentration_of_X_in_Y, where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical or biological species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as &quot;nitrogen&quot; or a phrase such as &quot;nox_expressed_as_nitrogen&quot;. The phrase &quot;expressed_as&quot; is used in the construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A. The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. Net primary production is the excess of gross primary production (the rate of synthesis of biomass from inorganic precursors) by autotrophs (&quot;producers&quot;), for example, photosynthesis in plants or phytoplankton, over the rate at which the autotrophs themselves respire some of this biomass. In the oceans, carbon production per unit volume is often found at a number of depths at a given horizontal location. That quantity can then be integrated to calculate production per unit area at the location. Standard names for production per unit area use the term &quot;productivity&quot;.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>tendency_of_mole_concentration_of_particulate_organic_matter_expressed_as_carbon_in_sea_water_due_to_net_primary_production</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>3ba9a808-8ca2-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>physical_parameters:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="41cef8aa37d1f0164ae061f293d4361c.html">pp (Primary Carbon Production by Phytoplankton)</a></li><li><a href="8416dffa-90ce-11e8-8e2e-a44cc8186c64.html">ppos (Primary Carbon Production by Phytoplankton)</a></li></ul></details><br><br><p><a href='../cf_standard_names.html'>Back to cf_standard_names</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
