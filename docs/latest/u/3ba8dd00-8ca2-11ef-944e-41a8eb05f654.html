In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, &quot;flux&quot; implies per unit area, called &quot;flux density&quot; in physics. The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. &quot;Litter&quot; is dead plant material in or above the soil. Heterotrophic respiration is respiration by heterotrophs (&quot;consumers&quot;), which are organisms (including animals and decomposers) that consume other organisms or dead organic material, rather than synthesising organic material from inorganic precursors using energy from the environment (especially sunlight) as autotrophs (&quot;producers&quot;) do. Heterotrophic respiration goes on within both the soil and litter pools.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>surface_upward_mass_flux_of_carbon_due_to_heterotrophic_respiration_in_litter</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>3ba8dd00-8ca2-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>physical_parameters:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="59136654-9e49-11e5-803c-0d0b866b59f3.html">rhLitter (Carbon Mass Flux into Atmosphere Due to Heterotrophic Respiration from Litter on Land)</a></li></ul></details><br><br><p><a href='../cf_standard_names.html'>Back to cf_standard_names</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
