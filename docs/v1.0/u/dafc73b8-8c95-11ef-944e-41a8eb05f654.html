The mass loss from these ice sheets is a key contributor to future sea level rise, and their freshwater input to the climate system provides an important forcing for ocean circulation and carbon and heat uptake. Ice sheets are also a key potential tipping element in the Earth System, so characterising this aspect of their future evolution may have huge societal impact.
</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Explain why this combination of data and experiments is important. How will it contribute to CMIP objectives?'><strong>expected_impacts</strong></td><td>The data requested from the Historical and Scenario simulations will primarily be used to create boundary conditions for a large ensemble of standalone Ice Sheet Model (ISMs) simulations under the auspices of ISMIP7, although some ESMs in CMIP7 may conduct these simulations with ice sheet components coupled in as well. The variables in the landice\_greenland\_allfreq and landice\_antarctica\_allfreq groups are primarily aimed at ISMs, but if any of the variables can be provided by an ESM is would be valuable. This combination output from ESM and ISM simulations will allow the future contribution of the icesheets to sea level rise to be projected and the model and scenario uncertainty of those projections to be characterised. In addition to ISMIP7, other MIPs concerned with ice sheet behaviour, primarily TIPMIP, WhatIfMIP and MISOMIP may use these variables.

Some output of piControl is requested as a way of calculating anomalies wrt the climate model equilibrium state - piControl030 would likely be sufficient.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Lead theme will coordinate communication and actions for the Opportunity'><strong>lead_theme</strong></td><td><span><a href="527f5c91-8c97-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654.html">Land &amp; Land-Ice</a></span></td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Default ensemble size, excluding multiple start times.
