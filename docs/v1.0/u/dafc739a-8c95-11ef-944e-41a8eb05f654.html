In addition to their application as input data for related modeling exercises (e.g., hydrology, lake, or glacier models, etc.), these sets of daily and monthly variables will be useful for (1) assessing the usability of Earth system models for water resources applications, (2) evaluating whether these processes/systems are adequately represented in the modeling frameworks, and (3) offering opportunities for model intercomparisons across these topics.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Explain why this combination of data and experiments is important. How will it contribute to CMIP objectives?'><strong>expected_impacts</strong></td><td>There are multiple use cases for these variables:
(1) Variables related to lakes (SST/lake surface water temperatures, lake fraction, lake depth, etc.) have been used in studies related to lake-atmosphere interactions [[1](<a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/34/12/JCLI-D-20-0751.1.xml" target="_blank">https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/34/12/JCLI-D-20-0751.1.xml</a>) and [2](<a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/atsc/79/5/JAS-D-21-0249.1.xml" target="_blank">https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/atsc/79/5/JAS-D-21-0249.1.xml</a>)] and usability of CMIP models for large lakes [[1](<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0380133021000289" target="_blank">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0380133021000289</a>)].
(2) Surface runoff variables used to assess model hydrological sensitivity and improve streamflow projections (e.g., [1](<a href="https://www-nature-com.cuucar.idm.oclc.org/articles/s41558-019-0639-x#Sec7" target="_blank">https://www-nature-com.cuucar.idm.oclc.org/articles/s41558-019-0639-x#Sec7</a>)]
(3) Snow water equivalent and soil moisture to assess terrestrial water storage anomalies [e.g., [1](<a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/34/20/JCLI-D-21-0021.1.xml" target="_blank">https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/34/20/JCLI-D-21-0021.1.xml</a>)]
(4) Water budget variables are important for assessments related to water availability and security, and hydrometeorological extremes (floods and droughts)
(5) A range of variables (e.g., precipitation, PET, etc.) have applications for hydrological simulations using bucket-type/watershed models.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Explain how the data products requested map onto the expected outcomes.
