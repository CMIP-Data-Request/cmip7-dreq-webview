The &quot;atmosphere content&quot; of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the atmosphere. For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard names including content_of_atmosphere_layer are used. The mass is the total mass of the particles.  &quot;Aerosol&quot; means the system of suspended liquid or solid particles in air (except cloud droplets) and their carrier gas, the air itself. Aerosol takes up ambient water (a process known as hygroscopic growth) depending on the relative humidity and the composition of the aerosol. &quot;Dry aerosol particles&quot; means aerosol particles without any water uptake. The specification of a physical process by the phrase due_to_process means that the quantity named is a  single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. &quot;Emission&quot; means emission from a primary source located anywhere within the atmosphere, including at the lower boundary (i.e. the surface of the earth). &quot;Emission&quot; is a process entirely distinct from &quot;re-emission&quot; which is used in some standard names. &quot;Net chemical production&quot; means the net result of all chemical reactions within the atmosphere that produce or destroy a particular species. &quot;tendency_of_X&quot; means derivative of X with respect to time. The term &quot;particulate_organic_matter_dry_aerosol&quot; means all particulate organic matter dry aerosol except elemental carbon. It is the sum of primary_particulate_organic_matter_dry_aerosol and secondary_particulate_organic_matter_dry_aerosol.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>tendency_of_atmosphere_mass_content_of_particulate_organic_matter_dry_aerosol_particles_due_to_net_chemical_production_and_emission</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>3ba9a6a5-8ca2-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>physical_parameters:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="a4e52f0f3833b395c09c73f1b6f3f748.html">emiaoa (Total Emission Rate of Anthropogenic Organic Aerosol)</a></li><li><a href="523886b41b608ce9215833b0406b9c27.html">emioa (Primary Emission and Chemical Production of Dry Aerosol Organic Matter)</a></li></ul></details><br><br><p><a href='../cf_standard_names.html'>Back to cf_standard_names</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
