It focuses on glaciers in the polar regions (including peripheral glaciers in Greenland and (Sub-)Antarctica that are decoupled from the ice sheets) and mountain glaciers, as identified in the Randolph Glacier Inventory (RGI). 
 
These glaciers have been the largest cryospheric driver of sea-level rise in the 20th century. Depending on the scenario (AR6), glaciers are expected to remain the primary drivers of sea-level rise during the 21st century, exceeding the contributions from the two ice sheets. They have significance in sustaining ecosystems, modulating regional hydroclimates, and as a freshwater resource (particularly in, but not limited to, seasonally arid regions like central Asia and the western slopes of the Andes). Through feedbacks in the mass balance response to climate change, glaciers are regional-scale tipping points in the Earth system and are an important element in assessing geohazards (e.g., glacial lake outburst floods, avalanches).</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Explain why this combination of data and experiments is important. How will it contribute to CMIP objectives?'><strong>expected_impacts</strong></td><td>(1) One important use case is the Glacier Model Intercomparison Project (GlacierMIP, under the umbrella of the WCRP CliC project), which is a coordinated intercomparison effort of global-scale glacier models aiming for model improvements and reducing uncertainties in global glacier projections. These involve historical and future simulations of glacier geometry change at century scales. The outputs from GlacierMIP have informed the IPCC Special Report on The Cryosphere and the Oceans in a Warming Climate (Hock et al. 2019) and IPCC AR6 report (Marzeion et al. 2020).
(2) Another use is integration of glacier melt in hydrologic models for accurate partitioning between glacier-melt, snow-melt, and baseflow contributions to runoff. This requires variables from terrestrial hydrology and snow processes at daily resolutions for sub-seasonal and seasonal assessments of streamflows.
(3) This opportunity will assist in the evaluation of the mountain cryosphere, with a particular emphasis on glaciers as important regional tipping points, which is a focus area of the WCRP CliC project. 
(4) The opportunity will further support assessments on local to regional-scale geohazards associated with glacier change under different scenarios, including glacial lake outburst floods, slope failures, avalanches and ice falls, etc.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Explain how the data products requested map onto the expected outcomes.
