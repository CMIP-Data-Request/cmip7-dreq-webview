A chemical or biological species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as &quot;nitrogen&quot; or a phrase such as &quot;nox_expressed_as_nitrogen&quot;. The phrase &quot;expressed_as&quot; is used in the construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A. &quot;Miscellaneous phytoplankton&quot; are all those phytoplankton that are not diatoms, diazotrophs, calcareous phytoplankton, picophytoplankton or other separately named components of the phytoplankton population. Phytoplankton are algae that grow where there is sufficient light to support photosynthesis.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>mole_concentration_of_miscellaneous_phytoplankton_expressed_as_carbon_in_sea_water</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>3ba74ea8-8ca2-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>physical_parameters:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="9a7cb6c8481412d525ba1101f82b892d.html">phymisc (Mole Concentration of Miscellaneous Phytoplankton Expressed as Carbon in Sea Water)</a></li><li><a href="c96d1a6a-c5f0-11e6-ac20-5404a60d96b5.html">phymiscos (Surface Mole Concentration of Miscellaneous Phytoplankton Expressed as Carbon in Sea Water)</a></li></ul></details><br><p><a href='../cf_standard_names.html'>Back to cf_standard_names</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
