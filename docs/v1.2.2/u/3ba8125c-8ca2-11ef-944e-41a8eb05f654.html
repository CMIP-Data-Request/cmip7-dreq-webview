However, the unqualified term &#x27;salinity&#x27; is generic and does not necessarily imply any particular method of calculation. The units of salinity are dimensionless and normally given as 1e-3 or 0.001 i.e. parts per thousand. Practical Salinity is reported on the Practical Salinity Scale of 1978 (PSS-78), and is usually based on the electrical conductivity of sea water in observations since the 1960s. &quot;Sea ice&quot; means all ice floating in the sea which has formed from freezing sea water, rather than by other processes such as calving of land ice to form icebergs.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>sea_ice_salinity</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>3ba8125c-8ca2-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>physical_parameters:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="5913e674-9e49-11e5-803c-0d0b866b59f3.html">sisali (Sea-Ice Salinity)</a></li></ul></details><br><p><a href='../cf_standard_names.html'>Back to cf_standard_names</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
