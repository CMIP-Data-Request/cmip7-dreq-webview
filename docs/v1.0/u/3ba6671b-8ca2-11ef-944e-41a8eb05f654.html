It may be expressed as a fraction, a percentage, or any other dimensionless representation of a fraction. &quot;Area fraction&quot; is the fraction of a grid cell&#x27;s horizontal area that has some characteristic of interest. It is evaluated as the area of interest divided by the grid cell area. Sea ice area fraction is area of the sea surface occupied by sea ice. The area threshold value must be specified by supplying a coordinate variable or scalar coordinate variable with the standard name of sea_ice_area_fraction. &quot;Sea ice&quot; means all ice floating in the sea which has formed from freezing sea water, rather than by other processes such as calving of land ice to form icebergs.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>fraction_of_time_with_sea_ice_area_fraction_above_threshold</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>3ba6671b-8ca2-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>physical_parameters:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="590e8b2a-9e49-11e5-803c-0d0b866b59f3.html">sitimefrac (Fraction of Time Steps with Sea Ice)</a></li></ul></details><br><br><p><a href='../cf_standard_names.html'>Back to cf_standard_names</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
