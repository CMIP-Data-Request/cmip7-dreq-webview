The daily resolution is essential to make more robust predictions at the level of individual species and functional types, e.g. by assessing the impacts of extremes (e.g. in river discharge) on ecological life cycles as well as phenological changes. Biodiversity and ecosystem services are essential for ensuring planetary health and human wellbeing. This opportunity complements related opportunities for terrestrial ecosystems.
</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Explain why this combination of data and experiments is important. How will it contribute to CMIP objectives?'><strong>expected_impacts</strong></td><td>The variables and experiments in this opportunity constitute typical input needed for process-explicit biodiversity models and for statistical biodiversity models relying on causal predictor variables. These span models for predicting spatiotemporal distribution and abundances of species or functional types, to models of fish migration and disease spread. The opportunity thus supports a broad set of use cases to model the positive and negative contribution of Nature to people.
</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Explain how the data products requested map onto the expected outcomes. Include reference to the level of resources that will be needed to support this request and why they are proportionate to the expected impact.'><strong>justification_of_resources</strong></td><td>Minimal variable set to allow model-based impact assessments on freshwater ecosystems. This request will facilitate a broad set of freshwater biodiversity and ecosystem services models, and will allow improved understanding of Nature’s contributions to people. Freshwaters have experienced the most severe losses in biodiversity and require urgent actions to halt biodiversity loss and restore ecosystem health. Improved freshwater biodiversity modelling based on high resolution climatic predictors will directly contribute to the efforts of IPBES to improve understanding of biodiversity and ecosystem services changes and improve scenario work.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Lead theme will coordinate communication and actions for the Opportunity'><strong>lead_theme</strong></td><td><span><a href="527f5c8f-8c97-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654.html">Impacts &amp; Adaptation</a></span></td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Default ensemble size, excluding multiple start times.
