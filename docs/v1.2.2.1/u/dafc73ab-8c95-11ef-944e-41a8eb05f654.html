It would be great if we can collect &quot;energy budget&quot; terms across the realms (ocean, land, cryosphere, atmosphere) in a coherent way, so we can most appropriately &quot;close&quot; (or more correctly approximate) energy budget changes in a model that can be contrasted to observations</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Explain why this combination of data and experiments is important. How will it contribute to CMIP objectives?'><strong>expected_impacts</strong></td><td>Having high-level energy budget metrics would be an ideal way of catching problem simulations that may have a very large imbalance that should be considered when interpreting projected fields (e.g. surface air temperature changes, and all the downstream changes that a larger/smaller warming would have on the climate system)</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Explain how the data products requested map onto the expected outcomes. Include reference to the level of resources that will be needed to support this request and why they are proportionate to the expected impact.'><strong>justification_of_resources</strong></td><td>Having energy budget metrics would provide very helpful overview insights that would aid assessing fitness for purpose across numerous downstream uses. It would be possible to capture these metrics in a compact (small storage footprint form), however, these would be most useful in the case that spatially complete fields were saved (potentially through timeslice sums, e.g. decadal sum/average) which allows interpretation of energy flows, and changes to these through the full length of a simulation (e.g. 1850-2022) for historical.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Lead theme will coordinate communication and actions for the Opportunity'><strong>lead_theme</strong></td><td><span><a href="527f5c93-8c97-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654.html">Earth System</a></span></td></tr><tr><td class='field_name' title='Default ensemble size, excluding multiple start times.
