It means the ratio of the mass of X to the mass of Y (including X). A chemical species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as &quot;nitrogen&quot; or a phrase such as &quot;nox_expressed_as_nitrogen&quot;. &quot;Aerosol&quot; means the system of suspended liquid or solid particles in air (except cloud droplets) and their carrier gas, the air itself. &quot;Ambient_aerosol&quot; means that the aerosol is measured or modelled at the ambient state of pressure, temperature and relative humidity that exists in its immediate environment. &quot;Ambient aerosol particles&quot; are aerosol particles that have taken up ambient water through hygroscopic growth. The extent of hygroscopic growth depends on the relative humidity and the composition of the particles. &quot;Pm1 aerosol&quot; means atmospheric particulate compounds with an aerodynamic diameter of less than or equal to 1 micrometer. To specify the relative humidity and temperature at which the particle size applies, provide scalar coordinate variables with the standard names of &quot;relative_humidity&quot; and &quot;air_temperature&quot;.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>mass_fraction_of_pm1_ambient_aerosol_particles_in_air</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>3ba74dd9-8ca2-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>physical_parameters:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="f86eb6c5-8ca1-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654.html">sfpm1 (PM1.0 mass mixing ratio in lowest model layer)</a></li></ul></details><br><p><a href='../cf_standard_names.html'>Back to cf_standard_names</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
