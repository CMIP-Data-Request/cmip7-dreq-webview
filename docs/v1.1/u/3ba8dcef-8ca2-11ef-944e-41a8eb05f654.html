In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, &quot;flux&quot; implies per unit area, called &quot;flux density&quot; in physics. The phrase &#x27;expressed_as&#x27; is used in the construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A. The chemical formula for carbon dioxide is CO2. The specification of a physical process by the phrase due_to_process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. &quot;Emission&quot; means emission from a primary source located anywhere within the atmosphere, including at the lower boundary (i.e. earth&#x27;s surface). &quot;Emission&quot; is a process entirely distinct from &quot;re-emission&quot; which is used in some standard names. The definition of &quot;crop&quot; is model dependent, for example, some models may include fruit trees, trees grown for timber or other types of agricultural and forestry planting as crops. Crop harvesting means the human activity of collecting plant materials for the purpose of turning them into forestry or agricultural products.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>surface_upward_mass_flux_of_carbon_dioxide_expressed_as_carbon_due_to_emission_from_crop_harvesting</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>3ba8dcef-8ca2-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>physical_parameters:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="590d9f1c-9e49-11e5-803c-0d0b866b59f3.html">fHarvestToAtmos (Harvested Biomass That Goes Straight into Atmosphere as Carbon Mass Flux [kgC m-2 s-1])</a></li></ul></details><br><p><a href='../cf_standard_names.html'>Back to cf_standard_names</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
