Net primary production is the excess of gross primary production (rate of synthesis of biomass from inorganic precursors) by autotrophs (&quot;producers&quot;), for example, photosynthesis in plants or phytoplankton, over the rate at which the autotrophs themselves respire some of this biomass. &quot;Productivity&quot; means production per unit area. The phrase &quot;expressed_as&quot; is used in the construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A. Diatoms are single-celled phytoplankton with an external skeleton made of silica. Phytoplankton are algae that grow where there is sufficient light to support photosynthesis.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>net_primary_mole_productivity_of_biomass_expressed_as_carbon_by_diatoms</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>3ba74f98-8ca2-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>physical_parameters:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="e527e1f0-dd83-11e5-9194-ac72891c3257.html">intppdiat (Net Primary Organic Carbon Production by Diatoms)</a></li></ul></details><br><p><a href='../cf_standard_names.html'>Back to cf_standard_names</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
