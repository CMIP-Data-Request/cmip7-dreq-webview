A chemical or biological species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as &#x27;nitrogen&#x27; or a phrase such as &#x27;nox_expressed_as_nitrogen&#x27;.The phrase &#x27;expressed_as&#x27; is used in the construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A.
