## Background

This project was developed at the [German Climate Computing Center (DKRZ)](https://www.dkrz.de/en/dkrz-partner-for-climate-research?set_language=en) 
as part of the [CMIP Data Request WebGUI (https://cmiphub.dkrz.de)](https://cmiphub.dkrz.de) effort, providing a web view
aligned with a similar tool created by Martin Juckes for the [CMIP6 Data Request](https://clipc-services.ceda.ac.uk/dreq/).
