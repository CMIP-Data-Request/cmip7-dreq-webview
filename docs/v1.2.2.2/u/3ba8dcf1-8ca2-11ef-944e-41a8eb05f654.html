The phrase &#x27;expressed_as&#x27; is used in the construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A. &quot;Fires excluding anthropogenic land use change&quot; means all natural fires and human ignited fires that are not associated with change of land use. In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, &quot;flux&quot; implies per unit area, called &quot;flux density&quot; in physics.  The specification of a physical process by the phrase due_to_process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase.  &quot;Emission&quot; means emission from a primary source located anywhere within the atmosphere, including at the lower boundary (i.e. earth&#x27;s surface). &quot;Emission&quot; is a process entirely distinct from &quot;re-emission&quot; which is used in some standard names. The chemical formula for carbon dioxide is CO2. &quot;Anthropogenic&quot; means influenced, caused, or created by human activity.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>surface_upward_mass_flux_of_carbon_dioxide_expressed_as_carbon_due_to_emission_from_fires_excluding_anthropogenic_land_use_change</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>3ba8dcf1-8ca2-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>physical_parameters:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="be3bec2766baa15a7d57b8c2689fdf3d.html">fFire (Carbon Mass Flux into Atmosphere Due to CO2 Emission from Fire Excluding Land-Use Change [kgC m-2 s-1])</a></li></ul></details><br><p><a href='../cf_standard_names.html'>Back to cf_standard_names</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
