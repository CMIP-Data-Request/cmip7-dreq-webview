The term &quot;shortwave&quot; means shortwave radiation. The TOA outgoing shortwave flux is the reflected and scattered solar radiative flux i.e. the &quot;upwelling&quot; TOA shortwave flux, sometimes called the &quot;outgoing shortwave radiation&quot; or &quot;OSR&quot;. In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, &quot;flux&quot; implies per unit area, called &quot;flux density&quot; in physics. A phrase &quot;assuming_condition&quot; indicates that the named quantity is the value which would obtain if all aspects of the system were unaltered except for the assumption of the circumstances specified by the condition. This 3D ozone field acts as a reference ozone field in a diagnostic call to the model&#x27;s radiation scheme. It is expressed in terms of mole fraction of ozone in air. It may be observation-based or model-derived. It may be from any time period. By using the same ozone reference in the diagnostic radiation call in two model simulations and calculating differences between the radiative flux diagnostics from the prognostic call to the radiation scheme and the diagnostic call to the radiation scheme with the ozone reference, an instantaneous radiative forcing for ozone can be calculated.</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>name</strong></td><td>toa_outgoing_shortwave_flux_assuming_reference_mole_fraction_of_ozone_in_air</td></tr><tr><td class='field_name'><strong>uid</strong></td><td>80ab7293-a698-11ef-914a-613c0433d878</td></tr></table><h2>Links from Other Categories</h2><details><summary><strong>physical_parameters:</strong></summary><ul><li><a href="f86eb6c0-8ca1-11ef-944e-41a8eb05f654.html">rsuto3ref (Top of atmosphere shortwave flux from diagnostic call to radiation scheme using a reference ozone field)</a></li></ul></details><br><p><a href='../cf_standard_names.html'>Back to cf_standard_names</a> | <a href='../index.html'>Category Index</a></p></body></html>
